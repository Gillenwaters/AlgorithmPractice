"Attention - is what we choose to focus on in any given time, meaning some other information isn't being perceive/processed."
"Attention can be described as the ability to focus on certain input or information while ignoring other input or information.  Just like with all processes that our brains perform, attention has both failures and successes.  One of the more common failures of attention results in what is called change blindness, which is often seen, or not seen, in movies.  Change blindness in the inability to notice subtle changes in a visual field.  For example, in one scene in a movie the main character is holding a hair brush and the next time you see them they are holding a comb instead.  Most individuals would not notice the change because it was not part of the information they were focused on or paying attention to.  One of attentions successes is found in endogenous attention.  Endogenous attention can be described by a situation where you are looking for your friend at a crowded party.  You know that see is wearing a blue dress, so you scan the room taking in all things that are colored blue until you ultimately find your friend.  The input you are absorbing is being selected from within because you were searching for ‘blue’.  This makes it a top down process.  This can be measured through the utilization of Posner’s Cueing Paradigm.  Posner’s Cueing Paradigm is a task of visual cues that differentiates between endogenous attention and exogenous attention.  The cues show the participant where to look and the time it takes to respond is measured.  If the response time is slow, it is endogenous.    "
"Attention can be described many different ways by a lot of people.  In psychology, attention is a process whereby some physical or nonphysical cues are either enhanced or inhibitted.  This means that attention is taking in some information and then to set some away.  When we inhibit some information the change blindness theory can come in to play.  This means that when we are presented with a physical cue that is constantly changing yet we do not pick up on the change, we are experiencing change blindness.  People are overwhelmed with somany cues and do not pick up on things like the change of physical environment. Endogenous attention has a voluntary aspect to it.  It also a top-down processing because the attention is driven fro within each person's brain, from their previous knowledge.  Posner conducted a study that reflected endogenous attention.  In his study, known as the Posner Cueing Paradigm, he would show people where to look by giving them cues and asking them to identify the target.  His results concluded that people can point out a target very quickly if they are cued in the right direction.  On the other hand, people who are mis-cued react very slowly and find the targets slower.    "
"Attention is a process during any given moment where some information is either enhanced or inhibited; furthermore, information that is enhanced can be further processed by our senses whereas inhibited information is put on the side and eventually forgotten. We involuntarily filter through information by giving attention to what we believe is more important, in turn, failing to attend to some information. Failing to attend to information tends to occur when you're given a lot of information at once; this failure to note information is referred to as failure of selection is space. A popular example of a failure of selection in space is change blindness, which is where a visual stimulus is introduced to or changed in someone's visual field without them noticing. This failure of selection often is caught when filming scenes for movies and TV shows. For example, there are many examples in the Harry Potter movies: Hermione's hair changing from crimped to straight in the same scene of the first movie and Ron's hair part changing from a middle to a side part in the same scene (also in the first movie). Moreover, change blindness is controlled by goals (what you want to get out of something) and focuses on what the main interest is of the given information while ignoring the inessential information at that time. An attentional process that is controlled by goals and focuses on top-down processing is endogenous attention (also called controlled attention). This type of attention is internal, meaning it originates within you or is something that you are voluntarily looking for or trying to focus on. An example of endogenous attention would be within Posner's cueing paradigm. This paradigm assess' one's attention by telling you where to look by giving you a fixation point. Once you're fixated on that point, a cue will appear in your visual field, grabbing your attention. After the cue appears, a target can pop up either in place of the cue or away from the cue, which is considered a mis-cue. When the target appears in place of the cue, this is called exogenous attention, which quickly catches your attention. When the target appears in a different location than the cue, it requires you to refocus your attention to where the target is located, which is an example of endogenous attention and is slower than exogenous attention. "
"Attention is a process that enhances information and inhibits other information. The enhancing is our brains further processing information, while inhibiting other information from interrupting the original processing. There are different roles of attention known as failures of selection and the successes of selection. The failures of selection in is when we fail to attend  to information. Sometimes we are not capable of processing simultaneous information at one time, so we tend to miss small changes that happen in front of us. When we fail to detect the physical changes in our space it is known as change blindness. We selectively attend to our central interest information, while ignoring everything else in a scene. The successes of selection is when we can efficiently select the necessary information we were looking for from input. One type of success is known as endogenous attention, it originates from our own knowledge so it is a voluntary process. A way to examine this type of attention is known as Posner's Cueing Paradigm and it studies how endogenous and exogenous cues can influence how we process information. Valid trials of this targets where presented at a cued location and participants were to press a key as they saw the target. In the invalid trails an arrow cued the opposite direction of the target. In these trials they were testing what may influence the  success of attending to the right target."
"Attention is a topic in psychology that has to do with what we are paying attention to. It is the act of focusing more on some information in the visual field, while choosing to ignore other information that we deem not as important. The act of processing what information is more important causes us to miss causal changes in the visual field, this is change blindness. If something is altered in the picture that wasn’t the focus of our attention, it is usually ignored and often times totally missed. However, if the change happens to something that we were enhancing our attention to, then we are more likely to catch the change. Attention can be tested using Posner’s cueing paradigm. In this test, they will tell you where they want your attention to be focused. Once it is focused on the mark, then they have a target pop up. This can be in the field of vision you were directed to look at, automatic attention, or it may not be, controlled attention. This test displayed that the controlled attention, where the target popped up at a different location then you were looking at, took longer to process since people to consciously change where they are looking."
"Attention is an integral part of our everyday lives and can be described as a process that hinders information from being processed and amplifies other information being processed.  Although many people, especially children, often claim to be paying attention they have a difficult time remembering important information later. That being said, our attention can be easily manipulated, where one thinks they are paying close attention, but still missing important details.  An example of this would include change blindness.  Change blindness is the inability to detect changes in our physical world, even though we think we are paying close attention.  This phenomenon may occur because, as humans, we are unable to process that much information at once, so often we miss details about our surroundings.  Although we may not detect all of the changes in our environment, Ponser's cueing paradigm explains that we are more likely to detect stimuli and changes if they are located somewhere that has been cued previously. One form of attention is endogenous attention and can be described as using top-down processing to select important information that should receive attention.  "
"Attention is focusing on a specific thing while ignoring everything else. Everyday we are constantly having to choose what to pay attention to because we are overloaded with information all the time. We tend to focus on what's important and meaningful and lose sight of the little things. For example, if someone asks you for directions on a map you would be focused on the map and giving good directions and not the person who asked. If the person who asked you for directions became someone else you may not even notice because your attention was not on them. This idea of missing subtle (or even large) changes because you were not focused on them is the idea of change blindness; being blind to change in your surroundings. If we have a specific goal in mind, like to memorize an equation for a test or the location of a target, we will focus all of our attention on that. Endogenous/controlled attention is attending to something because we chose to because it's meaningful to us. Posner's cueing paradigm uses attention and the idea of controlling attention. When we expect something and focus on that but the outcome is different, it takes us longer to comprehend than if it happened the way we had expected. It can be hard for us to change and relocate our attention to other things, especially whenever we had originally chose to focus our attention on it."
"Attention is one's ability to enhance certain tasks/things and ignore others simultaneously. Sometimes our attention can fail us because we are trying to hard to focus on one central interest. We can fail to notice major or minor things going on around us when we are focused on this thing, which is a phenomenon known as change blindness. However, sometimes we can change our attention voluntarily and have it work in our favor. This is known as endogenous attention when we control what we are enhancing or looking for, because it is based on your knowledge it is referred to as a top-down process. Posner studied endogenous and exogenous cues in his study where he would present the person with a valid cue, invalid cue or neutral cues. The valid cue would guide the subject to the location where the target would pop up. The invalid cue would put an arrow facing in the opposite direction to where the target would appear. Finally the neutral cues would have a mixture of invalid and valid. "
"Attention is something we perceive at any given moment in time that our brain is focused on more than something else going on in the same scenario. This is related to change blindness in that sometimes things happen, that we don't focus our attention on, and therefore, don't realize they happen. That is change blindness--something goes on and we don't even realize it. Our notes explain this by using scenes from movies. They show different shots and change little aspects that most people never even notice. That is because our attention is not usually focused on the small, insignificant aspects like that in movies. Endogenous attention comes from previously stored knowledge--you know what you are trying to focus your attention on. Therefore, when looking for something or someone, you have prior knowledge as to what it looks like, so you know what to look for. Posner started this experiment to test to test the components of attention and how location can effect ones attention and if you remove someone from a specific location where they presumed they were, it will affect whatever object it is they are trying to focus on."
"Attention is the ability to focus on some things while ignoring others. Change blindness is missing a change in your visual field. Endogenous attention is controlled attention from the top down processes. Posner's cueing paradigm is a visual cue task that showed the differences between endogenous and exogenous attention. Attention, change blindness, endogenous attention/controlled attention, and Posner's cueing paradigm all fit together by showing that there are two different types of attention, one being Endogenous attention/controlled attention, which were found by the visual cue task that is the Posner Cueing Paradigm. Attention is also linked to change blindness which is when you were focusing all of your attention on a certain thing that something goes missing in your visual field."
Attention is the amount of focus we are given to an object at any given time. Both change blindness and endogenous attention are forms of attention. Endogenous attention is considered top-down attention because it is when you are focusing your attention on something specific based on your prior knowledge of what you are looking for. Change blindness is when there are many major changes going on around us that we are not aware of because that is not what our attention is focused on so we tend to ignore it and not see it. Posner's cueing paradigm is a way to measure attention and attention changes.
Attention is the humanly process of which one has an understanding of information that is being given. The more attention that is given towards situations enhances the understanding. If one is not paying attention they endure the affects of change blindness which is inability to recognize change in physical aspects of situations. This can also be done if focus is selective and focuses on the most important parts. Something that could also be experienced within attention is the controlled attention that essentially focuses on how processing for new or difficult tasks are forced and less likely to be dual-tasked. Posner's cueing paradigm focuses on attention and analyzes the ability to do so focusing on reactions. This paradigm can aid in the gauging of someones controlled attention with concepts such as change blindness. 
"Attention is the process by which some information is enhanced and some information is inhibited. Endogenous attention, or controlled attention, is manipulated by top-down information which then selects which pieces of information are placed under focus. When this controlled attention fails, one is unable to notice certain aspects of the scene in front of them. This is an example of change blindness. Change blindness is the failure to observe physical changes within a scene. In these instances, attention is not drawn to the changes, and they can easily go unnoticed. However, in Posner's cueing paradigm, attention is drawn to a certain target. If the target is in the cued location, people are able to name the target rather quickly."
Attention is the process of enhancing information and inhabiting information. The change blindness is not being able to detect changes in the scene. Endogenous attention is something automatic.  Posner’s cueing paradigm is when a cueing comes up and you have to look for the target. When you are doing a Posner’s cueing paradigm you can see if you are using different attentions. If the cue is in the same spot then you are using an endogenous attention because the cued is in the same location but if it is a mis-cued then you are slower. All of these coincide with one another knowing that one feeds off of the other.
"Attention is the process of focusing on a specific part of your environment or situation you are in and blocking out other parts. An example of this would be if you are super focused while studying you will most likely not notice the different types of drinks people are ordering at the counter. We can control our attention, which is called endogenous attention. This is where we control what we are focusing on such as a book we are reading. Posners cueing paradigm is used to analyze an individuals 3 different types of attention they have. "
"Attention is the process of inhibiting some information, while enhancing the information that one is trying to further process. Essentially, we focus on things we want to process and ignore the things we don’t want to process. An instance where our attention fails us is when we fall prey to change blindness, which is when we miss big changes in our visual field. This occurs because we tend to selectively concentrate on the central interest information governed by our top-down processing. Another instance where we can see our attentions disrupted is shown in the Posner cueing task, an experiment done by Michael Posner. In the experiment, an individual is cued to look in a certain area for a target that will appear. If the target appears on the side that was cued, then automatic processing occurs very quickly; however, when the target appears somewhere that the cue was not directing the individual to look, this is considered a controlled, or endogenous, attention and will take more time to process. Endogenous/controlled attention is a process of attention which occurs in tasks that are challenging and new to an individual so this requires more effort and consideration during these tasks. This attention is internal, which means it is initiated within oneself, and operates using the top-down processing."
"Attention is the process that, at a given moment, enhances some information and inhibits other information. Change blindness is the failure to detect changes in a physical aspects of a scene. Endogenous attention is an attentional process which has a voluntary, top down aspect. Posner’s Cueing Paradigm is a model for attention that includes three separate mental operations: disengaging of attention; moving attention; and engaging attention in a new location. These terms fit together because they describe the process of how attention is received and divided."
"Attention is us processing outside information and we pay more attention to incoming information because we are wanting to use it to and focus on it. Change blindness is not being able to notices changes in things. Endogenous attention is thinking about actions we will do such as riding a bike and controlled attention is not being able to ignore things such as a firework going off. Posner's cueing paradigm is there are three separate mental processes we do. The first is we lose our attention from something. The second is paying attention to something else. The third is paying attention to a whole other new thing. How all of these relate is they all involve our attention and processing whatever it may be we are focusing on. An example I will use is riding a bike. To begin I am paying attention to this new fancy red bike, because for example I really like the color red so it has my attention. I am so drawn in by the color red and that bikes are awesome I don't notice the faint pink pen stripe marks on the bike that equal change blindness. I then think about me riding the bike the wind in my hair and how much fun it is that equals endogenous attention. I then decide to ride the bike and as I am riding it I hear a car horn that is when controlled attention comes into play. Posner's cueing paradigm can be described as me playing basketball and then all of a sudden I see this awesome red bike and it has my attention. I then notice the pink pen stripes and think well thats odd and clashes and that is the second part I move my attention to something else. Then the third I decide to get on the bike my attention is making sure the seat is high enough for me and it feels like the perfect fit."
"Attention is when we are consciously aware of something and we remain alert enough to focus on it and comprehend that it is occurring. Change blindness means that we have failed to notice changes that have taken place. We may think that we had been paying attention, but yet we may miss changes within a setting. This failure occurs because we are only paying attention to certain aspects, and ignoring many others. Endogenous attention is considered to be a top-down processing method, which means that it comes from your own knowledge and experiences. It also means that you can be easily distracted from the task. Posner's cueing paradigm is a way to recognize attention based on the participant's reaction times to given cues within the experiment. "
Attention is when we notice something. Change blindness is when we only pay attention to one thing and not its surroundings. Endogenous attention is goal-driven and controlled attention is stimulus driven. Posner's cuing paradigm is used to assess attention. It has been used to test the effects of disorders and brain injury on attention.
"Attention is when you select and process information. When looking at attention, we notice it can be easily swayed or you can be focusing on certain formation but not the rest of the information. To test this theory we can do something called posners cueing paradigm. This paradigm, is when a object shows up and it can be in two different spots. The observer then says whether or not it was in the specific location. Change blindness is involved in this because this is when visual change happens and the observer doesn't notice. Because of the rapid change within the paragrim, we can see that edogenous attention is disrupted. The change of stimulus makes the observer not notice the change."
"Attention seems simple when you originally hear it defined, but there is a lot more to it than just what you are focusing on. That is the most basic definition of attention: our process of focusing on certain information and not on others. It allows us to choose between what's important and needs to be processed and what can be discarded. Attention can be broken down into many facets, such as endogenous or exogenous attention. If you are walking through a busy street with many people on it but choose to focus on a hot dog vendor a block away as opposed to the crowd, you are using endogenous attention, or top-down or voluntary. It can be distracted by stimuli in the environment that steal attention, at which point the attention is considered exogenous. Attention is not fallible, however, as proved by the ability of stimuli to steal it. It can also fail to pick up changes in an environment, called change blindness. Change blindness is most commonly seen in movies when continuity errors occur, such as when the windows in the first Spiderman magically repair themselves after being shattered. Most people have a hard time noticing such things unless it is pointed out to them. Another popular example of change blindness is gorilla videos, which prompt participants to count passes of a ball between people, while a bunch of stimuli is happening around them. In the middle of all this a person in a gorilla suit walks through the scene, and commonly people don't see the gorilla! Studies such as the gorilla studies have been conducted for many years regarding attention. One such study was Posner's cueing paradigm. In this study, it was found that if cued, attention could be directed to a target quickly. However, if they are miscued, they are much slower to direct attention in the correct direction. These findings allowed Posner to distinguish between the three mental operations of attention: disengaging of attention, movement of attention to a new location, and engaging attention to that area. "
Attention: The ability to focus on one object or stimuli while being able to ignore another.
"Because attention has to do with focusing on one stimulus while ignoring another, this can often cause change blindness because we so concerned with a central area of interest that miss small changes our mind deemed unimportant. This kind of focused attention is considered to be endogenous attention. This attention can be seen in Posner's Cueing paradigm because the participant should be focused on the specific center object (cross, X). When another stimulus is flashed on the screen the participant's reaction time is monitored, showing exogenous attention. However, it is entirely possible for the participant to miss the stimuli flashed due to overattention and thus change blindness. "
"Change blindness is when a change in stimulus is introduced and an observer doesn't notice it. Attention is when concentrating on a some descrete information whether it is subjective or objective, controlled attention is the persons ability to choose what they want to pay attention too and what they don't want to pay attention to but endogenous attention which is voluntarily. Posner's cueing paradigm is a neuropsychological test that is used to asses attention. All these together all has to to with attention a change in attention or the observer noticing a change of the sort. "
Change Blindness: Missing changes in our environment
"Changs blindness - occurs because we think we see, remember, and notice more than we actually do. It occurs when we do not notice differences being made in our surrounding Because our focus is elsewhere. "
"Endogenous attention - attention that comes from a top down process. Therefore, coming from previous knowledge/experience. "
Endogenous Attention: Focused attention. Uses top down processing.
"For this section, we discussed attention. Attention is defined as a process that has the ability to increase or decrease the information that person is receiving. One of the experiments that completely alters your state of attention that was discussed was change blindness, which is when a person’s attention has failed to detect changes that may have happened in their environment and go unnoticed. There are many different experiments and examples of this phenomenon happing such as watching video of people passing a basketball, and you are to focus on the number of passes they complete. While your attention is increased on counting the number of passes, your attention is also decreased on being able to notice a gorilla passing through the game of pass. Another topic discussed in this section that sort of goes along with that phenomenon is Posner’s cueing paradigm. In this task, you are to be fixated on looking at a cross and they may begin adding in other shapes. When the shape is in the same spot, you are quicker at noticing that spot (exogenous attention), than if it were to have moved you would be much slower (endogenous attention). Your endogenous attention is more controlled and is much harder to do because you are looking at it in more of a context base and it is much slower to think in those terms. Like when you are looking for your mom in the store when she runs off to look at the purses. You have a much harder time looking for those distinctive features of your mom in an isle filled with purses and people rather than just shouting her name and getting her attention."
"I would describe attention is how we focus on something versus another. This goes hand in hand with change blindness because change blindness is where we miss something that we are looking at. This shows that visually we are not giving it our full attention. Endogenous/controlled attention is the attention you have control over. For example, if you want to give something your undivided attention or not. Posner's cueing paradigm is like a visual form of research to see whether we use endogenous vs. exogenous attention when visual cues appear or move. "
"Posner's cueing paradigm explained differences in attention. Our class saw a video where someone asked a stranger for directions. In the middle of the directions, two men moving something walked in between the two people talking. At the same time, the stranger needing attention switched out with another person. The person who was giving directions rarely noticed the change. This phenomenon is called change blindness. Attention is directing focus to something of importance. There are different kinds of attention. Endogenous attention is a top down process in which your attention is directed based on your goals. Controlled attention is more bottom up of a process where your attention is more of a reflex to a stimuli."
Posner's Cueing Paradigm: A visual cueing task to show the difference between controlled and uncontrolled attention. Uses a center target and monitors reaction time to a stimulus shown on the screen.
"Posner’s cueing paradigm is a test used to measure a person’s ability to see endogenous stimuli while the participant uses endogenous or controlled attention where they pay attention to the small + in the center of the page. Many participants think that they are paying attention or absorbing all the information that is in the entire testing area, but if a black line was introduced the participant would likely miss the black line, this is called change blindness where the participant does not pay attention to the black line stimuli."
"Posners - if you have a cue showing you what you're looking for, you'll find it more quickly and efficiently Than if you don't. "
"Psychologist often seek to understand individuals ability to pay attention, which is the ability to concentrate on information. Most importantly an individuals endogenous attention, and their ability to choose the area of concentration. Psychologist conduct experiments, to try and understand  a phenomenons called change blindness. Which is how individuals are able to focus on certain aspects but miss others. An example of this would be trying to remember which bowl the ball is underneath, while doing this the experimenter might have done something like change they color of the ball, the lights flicker, or they wouldn't notice a mouse run across the floor. To do this they use tests like Posner's cueing paradigm to determine an individuals likelihood of focusing their attention on several stimuli at once. Posner would have participants focus on a stimuli and record their reaction time to variable stimuli. "
"The concept of attention is the process of focusing your sensory field on one particular source of information for increased comprehension. There are several forms of attention that are driven by different processes of the brain. For example, endogenous attention is a top bottom process controlled by context. To demonstrate the difference between attention processes, researchers use Posner’s cueing paradigm. Posner’s cueing paradigm demonstrates how exogenous attention can lead to a faster identification of a targets and how miscuing endogenous attention will lead to missed targets. The idea of focusing your attention on a source of information makes it seem like missing information would be unlikely. Unfortunately, it happens quite often, the failure to notice a change in your perceptual field in called change blindness.  "
"The process of attention refers to the brain’s ability to discriminate between more and less relevant information in a situation. With the vast amounts of sensory information always coming into the brain for perception, giving more and less attention to different pieces of information allows for a better understanding, rather than a jumbled, overwhelming assortment of input information that can’t possibly be processed effectively. The limitation of attention is that it causes the brain to sometimes miss discarded information that actually is relevant. An example of this is change blindness, or the inability to notice differences in the various characteristics of one’s atmosphere because that information wasn’t gathered, stored, and processed like other information. Top-down processing is largely responsible for the discarding of sensory input that wasn’t given due attention and results in change blindness. More specifically, endogenous attention is at play and is controlled by top-down processing; it involves focusing on information that is relevant to an individual’s expectations of the situation he or she is in. The brain expects certain pieces of information to be detected by sensory organs, so the information that actually ends up existing that is consistent with one’s expectations is given more attention. The contrast of endogenous attention is exogenous attention. It is an involuntary process in which an individual is bombarded with unexpected stimuli, and his or her attention is forcibly directed towards the surprise stimuli. A common example of this is the cocktail party effect: an individual in a loud atmosphere suddenly has his or her attention captured because someone shouted their name (or something very similar in sound to it). A psychological attention test referred to as Posner’s Cueing Paradigm gives validity to the differences between endogenous and exogenous attention. The task shows how intentionally-focused attention (endogenous) results in faster recognition of a stimulus because it is expected. Contrastingly, attention being grabbed by a surprising and unexpected stimulus (exogenous) results in slower recognition and sets into motion three mental operations: stopping of endogenous, focused attention; the shift of attention from the expected stimuli to the actual exogenous one; and the brain’s focus of attention on the new stimulus."
"When people pay attention, which is noticing visual cues in everyday life, they can pick up visual cues of a photograph or an object. However, change blindness can affect this. Change blindness is when someone overlooks obvious changes in a photograph or a scene because they aren't paying attention. Change blindness occurs because of endogenous attention, which is the voluntary control of attention. Endogenous is the opposite of controlled attention. Posner's cueing paradigm explains the difference between endogenous attention and controlled attention."
"When studying attention, there are instance where there is too much information to be processed all at once. Part of the information will not be noticed as much as other information. These bits of information that are focused on more are a part of the attention process. Sometimes, when attention is on a specific element, and the other elements aren't as notable, and a change in the less notable elements occurs, it may go unnoticed. This is called change blindness.  A part of an attention process where one's attention is on a particular element in hopes to focus to a more specific element that you expect to find within those criteria, it is called endogenous attention. Michael Posner attempted to breakdown the components of attention in a study by having the participants shift their attention to a different element. Some of the participant's had difficulties with this, helping to understand shifting in attention through cues in the area of focus and cues not in the area of focus."
"When we watched the gorilla video in class my attention was on the people passing the ball and I experienced change blindness because I never saw the gorilla. Now that I've seen the video I know what I'm looking for and I see the gorilla because of prior knowledge ( endogenous attention). Also, if someone would have told me to look at the center of the screen during the video giving me a cue I would have more than likely noticed the gorilla (Posners cue paradigm). "
