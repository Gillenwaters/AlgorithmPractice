"Sensation is the environment stimuli our body processes and perception is how our mind interprets the stimuli our senses are receiving from our environment. We study this difference between sensation and perception because of the Many-to-Many problem. This is a problem where multiple different sensations can cause one perception or one sensation can result in many different types of perceptions. An example of this is how people interpret colors they see. One person can say that a certain color is black and another person could perceive it as navy. "
"A behavioral brain researchers, observes behavior and makes conclusions on the processing systems they are trying to observe. This method may seek to observe things like an individuals, reaction time, and their accuracy to a certain stimuli. Researches will create experiments that involve the participant to recall and answer questions over a given scenario. This is a positive way of researching and understanding brain process because it is very objective, inexpensive, and can reveal a variety of things. However, this doesn't show brains process, and is very limited in the amount of process, a researcher can seek to understand. "
"A process that takes place in the frontal lobe is the mexican wave. The mexican wave is a an electro chemical process that moves a message down the axon. It starts by a neurotransmitter attaching to a dendrite to bring the message to the axon. The mexican wave is also responsible for Broca's area by deciding how a person is going to respond in a conversation uses the mexican process. All of this takes place in the frontal lobe which is responsible for abstract thinking."
"A type of brain research connected to psychology is the effects of different medications on the brain. This is really useful in treating mental illnesses."
"A type of brain research is the behavioral method. The behavioral method is a study which the experimenter can see behavioral responses from the subject. An example of this is testing the accuracy and response time of an adult's to a third grade math quiz. This experiment would test how well adults can recall basic math skills and how quickly they can accomplish this task."
"After learning what and where the term attention comes from, we can now discuss different forms of attention that interfere with our visual fields. The first term, top-down processing, refers to our form of attention that we want to be looking for, or are focusing on. Whether you are painting your nails, or typing a homework assignment, you are looking for something that is the goal. With bottom-up processing, on the other hand, something has to capture our attention, such as someone sneezing, a dog barking, or someone hammering a wall; something out of the ordinary that we are not expecting. "
"AI- the programming of a computer/technology to perform or replace cognitive tasks. Experiments- they're what's conducted to show the relationship of things. The goal is to lead prove a hypothesis and gain a theory. Mind-brain- theory that the mind & brain states hold the same processes.cognitive psychology- a science that studies our mind/thinking/brain. A science, cognitive psychology uses different experiment methods to test and create technology like AI in order to test theories like the mind-brain theory. For example, researchers have tested different computer programs to see if they're capable of replicating the human mind-brain. They also conduct research/experiments to prove if the mind and brain are connected or separate."
"albers Artificial intelligence is designed to do something that humans do.   We did an experiment for class to see if we can test artificial intelligence.  It was done see if we can tell the difference between the computer and the real person.  The mind-brain are somewhat difficult to differentiate.  The brain is going to be based more on neurons, while the mind is more just thinking.  Experiments have been done to see if artificial intelligence works the same way that the brain and mind works when it comes to thinking."
"albers Attention is when we are focused on something that we are receiving information from.  Change blindness happens when our attention is on one thing and something goes on around it that we are not aware of because all of our attention is on something else.  It was very well demonstrated in the video with the two women talking, and there are others like it, like the basketball being passed as a bear walks through the middle of them.  Endogenous attention is looking for something specific, so you start out with something general like the color of it to narrow your options.  Posner's cueing paradigm is just as you are cued to look somewhere you able to quickly notice something.  When you are not cued you do not notice things as quickly as when you are cued. All of these terms have to do with attention.  Depending on what you are paying attention to, you may or may not notice certain things in a timely manner, if at all. "
"albers Cognitive psychology started with Wundt. He wanted to look at what we thought about when given certain words. "
"albers Embodied cognition is the connection between the brain and mind.  They are not the same but they are connected.  The mind is more thinking but in order to think we need the neurons firing which is part of the brain.  "
"albers I think that the frontal lobe would be the worst to break.  There is so much that is housed there when it comes to mental processes.  Your judgment is there as well as your speech. You could hear things but you would never be able to respond in anyway because you would not know how to respond. "
"albers The Mexican wave is simply sending a message through a neuron while neurotransmitters send the message between each neuron.  The frontal lobe is where Broca's is housed.  Broca's is what is responsible for speech production.  So for all of this to happen there has to be messages being relayed through the neurons with neurotransmitters to allow Broca's to be signaled to begin responding to what we are hearing."
"albers We may all experience the same sensations but everyone perceives things differently.  We all can look at an ink blob and see that it is a blob, but answers are going to vary from person to person on what they make of the blob."
"albers Word superiority effect, even though something may not be in the right order we can still read it because of our expectations.  We are expecting it to be something.  Top down processing is where you go from specific things to more general things. So therefore the bottom up processing is where you go from general things to get more specific things.  Feature matching is when you have a general idea of what things should be contain like the example in the lecture with the robin, it has wings, it sings, etc.  So, it must be a robin.  "
"All brain injuries are very traumatic, but in my opinion, damaging your frontal lobe would be the worse brain injury to endure. The frontal lobe is part of the brain that contains the most of the chemical, dopamine. Dopamine is associated with rewards, short term memory, motivation, attention, and planning. All these can be severely affected if the frontal lobe is damaged. Voluntary movement is also associated with the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex is located in the frontal lobe, so walking, standing up, sitting down could also be affected. Emotions, decision making, inappropriate responses, and abnormal behaviors are all common symtoms of someone enduring a frontal brain injury. That person is also more likely to suffer from strokes, seizures, and anyurisms, that could potentially result in death. "
"All of these are examples of attention. Attention is when at a given moment further processing enhances some information while inhibiting other information. Change blindness is when your senses do not detect a change in the physical aspects of the surrounding environment. Endogenous attention is top down attention. It occur internally and is voluntary. These are often new or difficult tasks that require a lot of focus. If you know that there are going to be changes in a scene in a movie, you will us endogenous attention to focus on the scene and find what is changed. Posner’s cueing paradigm is when you are shown a spot to look for the target, but you can either be cued or miscued. This paradigm shows three separate mental operations: disengaging of attention, movement of attention, and engaging of attention. This is another type of endogenous attention because you are focusing on that one spot that you were cued, not anything else."
"All of these terms fit together in the way our brains process images and information. For example the feature matching theory is way of explaining how our minds can interpret different symbols. For example, when looking at the letter L, we know there is one long vertical line, and on short horizontal line. Our brains can recognize that no other letter will have this shape which means it must be the letter L. Looking at a symbol and searching for a connection can also be considered a bottom-up processing approach. This means there is information streaming towards the brain, from the environment. On the other hand, top-down processing is creating information from what you already know in order to process information. When looking at an incorrectly spelled word, we use top-down processing by retrieving already learned information which then helps decipher how the word should be spelled. One very interesting phenomenon that goes along with this example is the idea of word superiority. Word superiority is a theory that explains that our minds have a much easier time recognizing letters within words instead of looking at the letter alone."
"All of these words refer to how the brain processes sensation and perception. Top down processing is a type of processing controlled by context information. Word superiority is an example of this. Word superiority is when you are able to read scrambled or misspelled words due to context cues, or placement of certain letter. Bottom up processing is driven by sensory information. Feature matching theory is a type of bottom up processing, specifically recognition. So, feature matching is when you have to have a specific set of features in order for recognition to occur."
"Almost all aspects of perception involve top down or bottom up processing. Bottom up processing is driven by sensory information we receive from our environment. Top down processing is controlled by our knowledge and tries to make sense of the sensory information presented to us. Once the sensory input is organized, the process of matching these representations to our stored memory is known as recognition. How well we recognize something depends on our previous experience with our world and context of the certain situation. Top down processing is known to influence our perception of object parts. The word superiority effect is when surrounding letters manipulate the perception of a target letter. Our minds recognize whole words by the context of letters, and our brains recognize words the easiest. There are four recognition theories we learned about and one is known as the Feature Matching theory. This theory believes that the way we process information is parallel, meaning we process information at the same time while it is distributed to areas in our brain. The model searches for simple but characteristic features of an object."
"An electroencephalogram (EEG)is a type of electrical research done on the brain. It is noninvasive technique that measures impulses in your brain. The researchers attach electrodes to your head that gives back information about where in your brain is being stimulated at a certain point over a certain task. "
"An example of an illusion discussed in class is the rubber hands illusion.  In this illusion, the perceptual process broken would be the multi-sensory perception and neural plasticity which the video explain to be the process in which the ""brain changes in response to experience"".  The brain is able to adopt a like object as its own when placed in a realistic environment."
"An example of an illusion tilt aftereffect. The tilt aftereffect process that is broken in this illusion that with neurons they are responding to the lines or what picture we might be looking at. Then when we change the image we are changing the neurons that are interputing it for us that give is the illusions that it might be moving and changing directions. Most of this takes place in the middle temporal location of the brain. The working parts in this area the cells help give us the sensation for an object moving. This area of the brain can be damaged or suffer from an injury this would be know as akinetopsia or motion blindness. Motion is a big role in our everyday life this would make for some major challenges especially driving not being able to tell how fast other cars are going or if one might be about to run into you. "
"An example of an illusion used in class is a depth cued illusion. You see an object such as a dragon statue and perceive the dragon to be facing you. As you walk around it it looks like it is following you with it's eyes. You think that you are seeing different sides of the figure but it is actually concave. Your mind is misinterpreting the visual cues of the depth of the object."
"An example of an illusion we discussed in class is the paintings on the ground. They are painted long and flat, but when you look at them head on it looks like the painting is standing up. This is a Depth cue illusion."
"An example of brain research is accuracy. This type of research falls under the behavioral category. It measures observable behavior and it can be used as converging or diverging evidence. Accuracy shows how much is a participant responds correctly. One example of this type of research is testing your memory. You are shown a list of words and you study these words for a certain amount of time. Then you recall as many as you can. The amount of words that you remembered shows your memory’s accuracy."
"An example of one of the illusions that we discussed in class was the motion illusion. There was a blurry black and white checkered circle that was in the middle of a pattern in focus. As you stared at the middle of the blurry circle you got the sensation that it was moving slightly. This occurs because of a process in the eye called nystagmus. The eyes are never completely still, they move slightly. This is an evolutionary trait that was developed so the eye could see stationary objects."
"an example would be change blindness, which occurs because we think we see, remember, and notice more than we actually do. It occurs when we do not notice differences being made in our surrounding Because our focus is elsewhere. Our class example was the gorilla video. Our visual perception process was ""broken"". "
"An experiment is used to test a hypothesis and form a relationship between variables. In an experiment there is often times an independent variable, which is manipulated, and a dependent variable, or the measured value. Experiments can be used to see what would happen, to examine theories, or to test a prediction. In cognitive psychology, the study of internal mechanisms and the mind, experiments are very often used. Cognitive experiments are used to understand thinking, language, perception, or to rationalize between the mind and the brain. Cognitive psychology was developed, in part, due to the computer. Computers have been heavily used in cognitive psychology and with technological advances, artificial intelligence is now part of life today. Artificial intelligence, is the use of technology to imitate normal human behavior without distinguishable indications. The Turing Test, named after Alan Turing, is an experiment that tests the ability of a computer to imitate human behavior. Artificial intelligence is not as advanced as Turing believed it would be by this point, as no computer system has successfully passed the test. A computer is unable to represent a human being without distinct signs. To understand this better, a deeper knowledge of mind-brain is needed. In the field of cognitive psychology, experiments are often done to understand the mind-brain approach, or how the mind and brain develop and how to relate the two. For example, experiments can be done to determine the biological processes in depression or anxiety. Thinking back to abnormal psychology, depression is more likely to occur in adolescence, and be linked to family history. Artificial intelligence may be lacking the knowledge and ability to use the mind-brain approach. Obviously, artificial intelligence is able to determine facts and concrete knowledge, but the connection between the mind and brain is insufficient enough to pass the experiment Alan Turing created for the field of cognitive psychology."
"An illusion is a perception that is misleading. One of the illusions we looked at in class was called Spots and Edges. In this illusion six rectangles that are the exact same size are in a row. Each rectangle is a different shade of gray, but each rectangle is uniformly colored. The right edge of the rectangle looks lighter than the left edge of the rectangle. Edge Detectors are the perceptual process being broken in this illusion. Edge detectors respond positively (on-off cells) on one side of an edge and then negatively (off-on cells) on the other side. These responses come from the ganglion neurons. "
"An illusion that we discussed in this course is the color illusion in relation to the American flag and how this helps break down the process of how color occurs in the eyes. The image that is present reflects the American flag to be black, yellow, and green, and our on/off neurons for these colors react to visualize these colors. After observing the flag for a few moments and these colors are taken away, which turns off our on/off neurons for these colors. After this occurs, our off/on neurons will give off a different set of colors when viewed on a white background. When viewing this white background, the off/on neurons will create an after image of a red, white, and blue American flag."
"An illusion, specifically a size/constancy illusion, that was discussed in class was the Meuller-Lyer illusion, which deals with arrows that are the same length but are stylized differently. When comparing the arrows, most people tend to say that the arrow with its peaks pointing inward is bigger than the arrow with its peaks pointing outward because it is longer. However, they are equal in size if you're measuring the length of the body of both arrows. In this illusion, the issue is that people interpret the whole picture together. This illusion is playing with your Gesalt rules by grouping the pointed arrows at the end of the body of the arrow with the body of the arrow. "
"Anytime you speak, you are using more of your brain than you're probably aware of. First, we begin with the frontal lobe (largest of the brain lobes), which is the part of the brain you would use when you express any cognitive skills like problem solving, emotions, judgment, etc. It also gives us our ability to consciously move our muscles (motor functioning). This part of the brain houses the Broca's area, which gives us our speech ability. Both of these areas of the brain are able to communicate the wanted action to our muscles through neurotransmitters and the ""Mexican wave"" transmitters, which are neurons that are able to communicate to one another. Neurotransmitters communicate between each cell, while ""Mexican wave"" transmitters communicate within the cells."
"Artifical intelligence is using a form of technology that can rely information to you. Experiments are activities you do to test a hypothesis, independent, and dependent variable. Cognitive psychology it means literally our thinking minds what we are perceiving and sensing through the outside world around us. Mind-brain is what actually goes on in our brains the processes of neurons and the lobes. How all of these fit together is we can use artifical intelligence by using Siri she is an artifical intelligence form of technology that you can ask her questions and she will look up questions you have about your experiment for example. How do we know to look up stuff and process information about our experiments? We use our thinking minds and how we process the information we learn it goes through our brain to the frontal lobe. This lobe is what helps us process abstract thinking which consists of the primary motor cortex and our attention processing which is called the prefrontal cortex. This lobe is tremendous for solving experiments."
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the using of computers to simulate the human mind. Experiments are studies to find causal relationships between things. Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind. The mind-brain connection is the idea that the brain and the mind complement each other. These terms fit together because they explain that cognitive psychology is more of a science than anything else. Cognitive Psychology was directly linked to the development of the computer which is why AI is used. The computer would be compared to the human brain."
"Artificial intelligence involves using computers to simulate the human mind. Companies are constantly building artificial intelligence programs to mimic human interactions. The Turing test is an experiment, or scientific investigation, that determines whether or not people can differentiate between a human and a computer. A group of people is each given two sets of answers to a list of questions and must determine which set of answers an actual person gave. If the computer passes the Turing test, then it was able to fool people into thinking it was human. In cognitive psychology, or the study of how people think, the goal is not to build a computer that can trick people into thinking it is human. The objective is to use the computer as a model and decide if the predictions that it makes about how a human responds are accurate by testing human subjects. It acts as a time saving tool to gain understanding of the brain. Cognitive psychologists take a model that they think simulates a human and test it to see if it performs as such. The Information Processing Approach is a theory of cognition that relates the mind to a computer in term of storage of information, manipulation of information, and transformation of information. This model is used to study how the brain functions. Essentially, the brain fires neurons and the mind deciphers what is going on. This idea that the mind is emergent from the brain’s processes is called the mind-brain connection."
"Artificial Intelligence is a computer that acts as a human would. Some believe the mind is the soft ware and the brain is the hard ware of a computer, metaphorically speaking. Some believe the person is seperate from the brain."
"Artificial intelligence is a development of a computer that will be able to perform tasks that a human intelligence would be able to do such as sight, translating from different languages, speech, and decision-making. Experiments is a scientific procedure that performs a sequence of operations and basically observe the results of the experiment. Cognitive psychology basically focuses on the way people process information. Mind-brain is broken up into two different definitions. The mind basically deals with the part of a person that has the ability of thought. The brain is basically the physical organ inside the skull. These terms all fit together because artificial intelligence can be used as an experiment to show the cognitive psychology from the mind-brain of the computer or human being."
"Artificial intelligence is better known as some type of machine or product that is supposed to ""think"" like a human. This could be a computer, phone, TV, basically any electronic device or machine. Artificial intelligence is used within cognitive psychology, because of the computer. Cognitive psychology is the study of the brain or mind and its function. This area of psychology became a big hit when the computer came around. Psychologists wanted new ways to experiment how humans process information and compare it to how a computer processes information. An experiment is a way to test a hypothesis. For example, if psychologists said that cognitive psychology is the same as artificial intelligence, they could run an experiment to test their hypothesis to see if it is true. They can compare the two and look at the results, which is exactly what they wanted to do after the computer came around. They wanted to see the differences between our mind-brain and how humans understand information, and a machine and how it processes the information given to it. "
"Artificial intelligence is the ability of computers to react and think like humans. For example, speech recognition in our iPhones called Siri or certain video games. For years many people have felt that video games such as Minecraft develop or encourage violent behaviors. Other people feel that it is not possible and those individuals that seem effected by the game were already violent to begin with.  Experiments have been done on this subject, and on some of the capabilities of the game to build structures and buildings while using AI as it interacts with the players. A couple differences between our brain and AI is that our mind uses several different paths to solve a problem and then can make a logical decision; while AI uses a more step by step path and can only do something when asked or prompted to do so. Cognitive psychology and AI share similar ideas that the brain is an information processing device which AI tries to copy and resemble. Cognitive psychology experiments have and can be done to look into how a human brain can use past experiences to make decision while AI cannot. In the future many scientists wish to change this fact, and I look forward to what they discover."
"Artificial intelligence is the design of a computer to mimic the mind/act like a human, it inspires other research on cognition as well. Experiments is looking for casual relationship between variables, it must manipulate variables. Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind. Mind-brain approach attempts to determine where the mind and brain connect. Artificial intelligence, experiments, cognitive psychology, and mind-brain all fit together by the use and creation of cognitive psychology in correlation with the computer and with experimentation such mind-brain approach to finding the connection and then creating the computer which led to artificial intelligence. "
"Artificial intelligence is the development of computers to act in the same process as a human brain.  Experiments are the trials associated with hypothesis and theories.  Cognitive psychology is the idea that the human brain is a complex computer system.  Mind-brain is the different associations in the brain which aid in cognitive processing or automatic responses. Through the development of artificial intelligence, scientists match the cognitive psychology idea to perform experiments on the human brain in order to develop various systems for computers.  The brain in studied to determine mind-brain or active processing in order to match the thought process of computers to the same process of humans."
"Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of a computer, being able to perform tasks that often require human intelligence. It is an attempt to create an artificially cognitive being. The AI will attempt to perform tasks such as speech recognition, location devices, decision making, translation, and even visual perception. Many experiments, or scientific procedures in attempt to make a discovery or test a hypothesis are researched for artificial intelligence. For example, a turing test experiment is a test developed by Alan Turing, that is to test the intelligence in a computer, requiring that a human being should not be able to tell the human and machines responses apart. This is related to cognitive psychology, or the scientific study of our minds, brains, and mental function. Recently, artificial intelligence researchers have reached out to cognitive psychologists in hopes that they will gain a better understanding of cognitive science to improve already rapidly improving AI. In order to create an AI such as siri, Apple stores human activity and behavior from your phone, computer, Ipad, etc, in order to gain a better understanding of the human brain and how it responds on a day to day basis. Finally, we have to understand that the mind and the brain are two different things. The brain refers to the physical organ that sits behind our skulls. The mind refers to the brain's ability of thought and consciousness. Although, artificial intelligence reseachers and cognitive psychologist can study different indexs of the brain, our mind makes us who we are, giving us a personality, which researchers are extremely interested in for the development of new artificial intelligence. "
"Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform that normally require human intelligence for example visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making. An experiment is a scientific procedure undertaken to make a discovery on something, test a hypothesis, or demonstrates a known fact, it is a scientific procedure. Cognitive psychology this is a concern with mental processes such as perception, thinking, learning, and memory. Mind-brain mental processes, thoughts and con is the consciousness brain is the aspects is how the brain i structured. These all pair well together because it all has to do with the human brain it all has to require some sort of human activity and a theory, we want to demonstrate something and we need to be able to test that theory about the brain and the abilities that are capable."
"Artificial intelligence is the use of a computer to imitate a human’s thought and response processes. Experiments are the study of causal relationships between things by manipulating the variables. Cognitive psychology is the research of the thinking mind and mental activity. The mind-brain is an approach that tries to figure out where the mind and brain meet. Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind, while the mind-brain approach tries to determine where the mind and brain connect. Both use experiments to research the brain and human behaviors. By studying these concepts, technological advances are being made in the field with the ability of a computer’s artificial intelligence being more capable of imitating human response, thinking, and behavior."
"Artificial intelligence is the use of a computer to mimic the human brain, while experiments are used to measure causal relationships between variables where variables are manipulated. Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind and mind the mind brain attempt to show how the mind and brain connect. These terms fit together because they seek to discover the brain and how it works and how the mind and brain are interrelated."
"Artificial intelligence is using a computer it be able to make you feel like you are talking with an actual human. Experiments are used to understand why one thing causes another thing to happen. So in relation to artificial intelligence the would use experiments to see if artificial intelligence could make you believe they where an actual person. Cognitive psychology is a science that is tested through experiments such as the mind brain states that the brain group events."
"Artificial intelligence is using computers to perform human cognitive tasks.  Experiments are when we test our hypotheses and record our results.  Cognitive psychology is the study of our minds.  Mind-Brain is the interaction between our physical brain and our mental thoughts and processes. In the field of cognitive psychology, researchers often conduct experiments on the efficiency of artificial intelligence in today's technological world. We can use artifical intelligence in many ways to trick humans into thinking that they are interacting with another live human being over the internet, when they are actually interacting with a computer. This type of experiment would look at the mind-brain of the participant interacting with the computer throughout the conversation. "
"Artificial intelligence is when a computer can perform tasks that only humans could do before, such as decision making. Artificial intelligence is used all over experiments in psychology to test how human-like it can get. It relates to cognitive psychology because it mimic human traits such a decision making, memory, and perception. Mind-brain is when we actually perceive things as opposed to just thinking of them as brain processes, which artificial intelligence is not capable of."
"Artificial intelligence is when computer systems can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Experiments are when you look for causal relationships between variables by manipulating a variable. Cognitive psychology is the focus on the way that people process information."
"Artificial intelligence refers to developing computers to interact with people in the same way that a human would. Artificial intelligence is getting smarter and now is capable of decision-making and voice recognition. It can perceive visual images too. In cognitive psychology, the brain and mental processes are being studied. The mind-brain refers to the relationship between the mind and the brain. The mind refers to the consciousness and awareness, while the brain is more of the actual intelligence. Experiments, which are science-based tests, are done to learn how the mind-brain works functions. Experiments also help us see how consciouness is just as important as the brain's intelligence. "
"artificial intelligence-use of computers to stimulate the mindCognitive psychology is a science that studies the way our mind thinks, makes coherent thoughts, etc.  Within cognitive psychology, scientists conduct experiments. When experiments are conducted psychologists are often looking for a causal relationship between two things.  In order to ensure things are casual, psychologists manipulate and observe the variables.  Experiments in cognitive psychology can often lead to theories.  An example of a cognitive psychology theory would include the mind-brain theory.  This theory states that the brain and the mind are separate and have different functions. The brain contains the physiological level of functioning, including things like neurons, neurotransmitters, and so on.  The mind incorporates more of the thinking functions and can be described as emergent of the brain.  Our reality, however, is formed by our mind.  Theories like these can continue to lead to more experiments in cognitive psychology, which in turn leads to more theories.  Artificial intelligence stimulates the mind part of our mind-brain through the use of computers.  "
"Artificial intelligence:  the ability of a computer to perform tasks usually associated with human intelligence.  Experiments:  a scientific procedure to prove a theory and/or make a discovery. Cognitive psychology:   the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of the mental processes involved in attention, language, reasoning, perception, memory, problem solving, and decision making.    The scientific study of all mental processes and the mind.  Mind:  system that creates and controls mental functions such as perception, attention, emotions, deciding, memory, language, reasoning, and thinking and that creates mental representations of the world.  Brain:  an organ in which the mind and all processes takes place.  All of these terms work with the brain and how intelligence works in the brain and mind.  Artificial intelligence, is a man made mind/brain that is used for experiments in cognitive psychology.  "
"Artificial Intelligence: Using computers to simulate the human mind. Experiments: The search for causal relationships between independent variables. One variable MUST be manipulated or else it becomes correlational.Cognitive Psychology: The study of the thinking mindMind-Brain: a theory that questions at what point the mind (mental) and the brain (physiological) connect.The mind brain theory, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence go hand in hand. Without studying the thinking mind, and doing experiments to gain results and learn more, we would not have the mind brain theory. The theory claims that the mind is emergent from the brain's processes. However, after more research and experimenting, it has been shown that the mind can be simulated through a computer system WITHOUT any of the physiological processes that the human mind does. "
"Artificial intelligences are a computer program that models the human brain.  Experiments are something we are able to test that have an either an independent variable and or dependent variables. Cognitive psychology is how we are thinking about something. The mind-brain is the part of your brain that deals with memory of storage and the transformation of information. The AI has a storage system just like the mind-brain like the ram in a computer. The AI also is a system that we use for experiments to know what people are thinking about which is our cognitive psychology."
"As we talked about in lecture, scientists are very curious individuals. One specific type of scientist is one that studies cognitive psychology, which is the thinking mind. The development of this branch of psychology had a lot to do with the initiation of the computer. Scientists thought that if they could look at human minds and compare that to the way a computer ""thinks"", they could get some answers. At this point, the idea of a computer design that could actually mimic a human was introduced and called artificial intelligence. With this new information, questions were asked and theories developed. One theory that has developed is called the mind-brain theory. This theory is interesting because it attempts to discover where the mind and brain connect. Because there are always multiple theories, the theories must be tested. Like all other sciences, cognitive psychology is tested through experiments. These experiments are procedures used to find casual relationships between the variables being tested."
"Ask a person the question what are they thinking about and they may easily answer that question but ask a person what is their definition of a thought or to explain the process behind thinking and a blank stare or shrugged shoulders might be their response. Questions about the definition of a thought or the thought process are so difficult to answer that people have created a branch of psychology that is devoted to answering those questions and of course similar questions. The branch of psychology that is devoted to the study of the mental process is called a psychology and like any branch of science worthy of its status it attempts to answer questions about the mental process by using the scientific method. In case anyone has forgot a crucial step in the scientific method is the experiment. An experiment is a procedure that sets out to verify, dispute or support a hypothesis. At one time in the past someone may have proposed a hypothesis that there is a link between the mind and the brain. The link between the brain and cognition has been referred to as mind-brain, big shock on that one. In attempt to either proof the existence of, disproof the existence of or support the existence of scientist have ran countless of experiments. The cornerstone of any solid theory is proof and since we as people like to see proof in action scientist have worked for several hours and for several decades on manufacturing visible proof. Proof of what?  That the process behind the thought can be physically demonstrated or mimicked is one example. Artificial Intelligence, a result of the cognitive revolution, in layman terms is the process in which a machine through cutting edge technology mimics cognitive function."
"Attention - is what we choose to focus on in any given time, meaning some other information isn't being perceive/processed."
"Attention can be described as the ability to focus on certain input or information while ignoring other input or information.  Just like with all processes that our brains perform, attention has both failures and successes.  One of the more common failures of attention results in what is called change blindness, which is often seen, or not seen, in movies.  Change blindness in the inability to notice subtle changes in a visual field.  For example, in one scene in a movie the main character is holding a hair brush and the next time you see them they are holding a comb instead.  Most individuals would not notice the change because it was not part of the information they were focused on or paying attention to.  One of attentions successes is found in endogenous attention.  Endogenous attention can be described by a situation where you are looking for your friend at a crowded party.  You know that see is wearing a blue dress, so you scan the room taking in all things that are colored blue until you ultimately find your friend.  The input you are absorbing is being selected from within because you were searching for ‘blue’.  This makes it a top down process.  This can be measured through the utilization of Posner’s Cueing Paradigm.  Posner’s Cueing Paradigm is a task of visual cues that differentiates between endogenous attention and exogenous attention.  The cues show the participant where to look and the time it takes to respond is measured.  If the response time is slow, it is endogenous.    "
"Attention can be described many different ways by a lot of people.  In psychology, attention is a process whereby some physical or nonphysical cues are either enhanced or inhibitted.  This means that attention is taking in some information and then to set some away.  When we inhibit some information the change blindness theory can come in to play.  This means that when we are presented with a physical cue that is constantly changing yet we do not pick up on the change, we are experiencing change blindness.  People are overwhelmed with somany cues and do not pick up on things like the change of physical environment. Endogenous attention has a voluntary aspect to it.  It also a top-down processing because the attention is driven fro within each person's brain, from their previous knowledge.  Posner conducted a study that reflected endogenous attention.  In his study, known as the Posner Cueing Paradigm, he would show people where to look by giving them cues and asking them to identify the target.  His results concluded that people can point out a target very quickly if they are cued in the right direction.  On the other hand, people who are mis-cued react very slowly and find the targets slower.    "
"Attention is a cognitive process that allows the brain to focus on certain information and ignore other stimuli. There are times when attention works, and times it doesn't. Attention can be lost due to failure of selection in space. For example, change blindness is when we focus on a specific part information in our visual field and miss the rest of the information. Flickers between images with small changes is a good example of change blindness. We often don't notice the small changes in the picture.  Besides the failures in attention, there are times when it works really well for us. Endogenous attention is controlled focus due to personal goals. It comes from within to motivate where your attention is directed. This helps people focus on information that is important to them. Posner's cueing paradigm demonstrates these ideas using a psychological experiment that tests your attention. It tells you a target and where to look. When the target is in the cued location, people are very quick to name it. If it doesn't show up where they're expecting it to, the results are much slower because your attention has to pick up and move your focus to another place in your visual field."
"Attention is a process during any given moment where some information is either enhanced or inhibited; furthermore, information that is enhanced can be further processed by our senses whereas inhibited information is put on the side and eventually forgotten. We involuntarily filter through information by giving attention to what we believe is more important, in turn, failing to attend to some information. Failing to attend to information tends to occur when you're given a lot of information at once; this failure to note information is referred to as failure of selection is space. A popular example of a failure of selection in space is change blindness, which is where a visual stimulus is introduced to or changed in someone's visual field without them noticing. This failure of selection often is caught when filming scenes for movies and TV shows. For example, there are many examples in the Harry Potter movies: Hermione's hair changing from crimped to straight in the same scene of the first movie and Ron's hair part changing from a middle to a side part in the same scene (also in the first movie). Moreover, change blindness is controlled by goals (what you want to get out of something) and focuses on what the main interest is of the given information while ignoring the inessential information at that time. An attentional process that is controlled by goals and focuses on top-down processing is endogenous attention (also called controlled attention). This type of attention is internal, meaning it originates within you or is something that you are voluntarily looking for or trying to focus on. An example of endogenous attention would be within Posner's cueing paradigm. This paradigm assess' one's attention by telling you where to look by giving you a fixation point. Once you're fixated on that point, a cue will appear in your visual field, grabbing your attention. After the cue appears, a target can pop up either in place of the cue or away from the cue, which is considered a mis-cue. When the target appears in place of the cue, this is called exogenous attention, which quickly catches your attention. When the target appears in a different location than the cue, it requires you to refocus your attention to where the target is located, which is an example of endogenous attention and is slower than exogenous attention. "
"Attention is a process that enhances information and inhibits other information. The enhancing is our brains further processing information, while inhibiting other information from interrupting the original processing. There are different roles of attention known as failures of selection and the successes of selection. The failures of selection in is when we fail to attend  to information. Sometimes we are not capable of processing simultaneous information at one time, so we tend to miss small changes that happen in front of us. When we fail to detect the physical changes in our space it is known as change blindness. We selectively attend to our central interest information, while ignoring everything else in a scene. The successes of selection is when we can efficiently select the necessary information we were looking for from input. One type of success is known as endogenous attention, it originates from our own knowledge so it is a voluntary process. A way to examine this type of attention is known as Posner's Cueing Paradigm and it studies how endogenous and exogenous cues can influence how we process information. Valid trials of this targets where presented at a cued location and participants were to press a key as they saw the target. In the invalid trails an arrow cued the opposite direction of the target. In these trials they were testing what may influence the  success of attending to the right target."
"Attention is a process that enhances some information and inhibits other information. It allows us to select certain information and ignore other information. Change blindness is when you miss a change that occurs in your visual field. Endogenous attention is controlled attention from top down processes. This means that we start with a broader image and work our way down to more detailed information about that image. Posner's cueing paradigm showed the differences between endogenous and exogenous attention by showing that if people are in a cued location, they will be quick to name a target. If they are in a mis-cued location, they will be slower to name a target. Change blindness branches from attention. Attention allows you to select certain information and ignore other information. Change blindness is similar. We select what things to pay attention to; this causes us to not see certain things in our vision field. This relates back to attention allowing us to inhibit this ability of selection of information. Endogenous attention branches from both attention and change blindness because we are selecting to pay attention to a broader image, and then selecting to pay more attention to the detail of that image. So originally, we could be change blindness because we are not paying attention to the details of the object, however, that changes because we shift from the broader picture to paying attention to the details of the object. Posner's cueing paradigm measues this change of endogenous attention. It shows how our brain goes from the broader picture to the more detailed information."
"Attention is a topic in psychology that has to do with what we are paying attention to. It is the act of focusing more on some information in the visual field, while choosing to ignore other information that we deem not as important. The act of processing what information is more important causes us to miss causal changes in the visual field, this is change blindness. If something is altered in the picture that wasn’t the focus of our attention, it is usually ignored and often times totally missed. However, if the change happens to something that we were enhancing our attention to, then we are more likely to catch the change. Attention can be tested using Posner’s cueing paradigm. In this test, they will tell you where they want your attention to be focused. Once it is focused on the mark, then they have a target pop up. This can be in the field of vision you were directed to look at, automatic attention, or it may not be, controlled attention. This test displayed that the controlled attention, where the target popped up at a different location then you were looking at, took longer to process since people to consciously change where they are looking."
"Attention is an integral part of our everyday lives and can be described as a process that hinders information from being processed and amplifies other information being processed.  Although many people, especially children, often claim to be paying attention they have a difficult time remembering important information later. That being said, our attention can be easily manipulated, where one thinks they are paying close attention, but still missing important details.  An example of this would include change blindness.  Change blindness is the inability to detect changes in our physical world, even though we think we are paying close attention.  This phenomenon may occur because, as humans, we are unable to process that much information at once, so often we miss details about our surroundings.  Although we may not detect all of the changes in our environment, Ponser's cueing paradigm explains that we are more likely to detect stimuli and changes if they are located somewhere that has been cued previously. One form of attention is endogenous attention and can be described as using top-down processing to select important information that should receive attention.  "
"Attention is difficult to define because many people will argue about the specifics, but a general definition of attention is a process that our brain uses to focus on. The brain will decide if the information is important or not, and if it is, the brain will continue to put all focus on it. There are a few different kinds of attention, one is endogenous attention which is attention caused by reflex. This is the kind of attention you use when you are startled by something. The other kind of attention is controlled attention, where you specifically seek out a certain object and focus your attention on it. An example of this is studying. But as humans, we make mistakes and sometimes these mistakes are caused by attention. Change blindness is a phenomenon that happens to us, when our attention fails us. Change blindness is when there is a big change in our visual field and we don't notice it. This happens a lot in movies, when something in the scene changes in between cuts. "
"Attention is focusing on a specific thing while ignoring everything else. Everyday we are constantly having to choose what to pay attention to because we are overloaded with information all the time. We tend to focus on what's important and meaningful and lose sight of the little things. For example, if someone asks you for directions on a map you would be focused on the map and giving good directions and not the person who asked. If the person who asked you for directions became someone else you may not even notice because your attention was not on them. This idea of missing subtle (or even large) changes because you were not focused on them is the idea of change blindness; being blind to change in your surroundings. If we have a specific goal in mind, like to memorize an equation for a test or the location of a target, we will focus all of our attention on that. Endogenous/controlled attention is attending to something because we chose to because it's meaningful to us. Posner's cueing paradigm uses attention and the idea of controlling attention. When we expect something and focus on that but the outcome is different, it takes us longer to comprehend than if it happened the way we had expected. It can be hard for us to change and relocate our attention to other things, especially whenever we had originally chose to focus our attention on it."
"Attention is one's ability to enhance certain tasks/things and ignore others simultaneously. Sometimes our attention can fail us because we are trying to hard to focus on one central interest. We can fail to notice major or minor things going on around us when we are focused on this thing, which is a phenomenon known as change blindness. However, sometimes we can change our attention voluntarily and have it work in our favor. This is known as endogenous attention when we control what we are enhancing or looking for, because it is based on your knowledge it is referred to as a top-down process. Posner studied endogenous and exogenous cues in his study where he would present the person with a valid cue, invalid cue or neutral cues. The valid cue would guide the subject to the location where the target would pop up. The invalid cue would put an arrow facing in the opposite direction to where the target would appear. Finally the neutral cues would have a mixture of invalid and valid. "
"Attention is our ability to focus on information by inhibiting other information for the goal of only focusing only on one piece of information at a time.  Endogenous attention is our ability to shift our attention voluntarily.  Change blindness is the idea that when a person is viewing something, and one detail changes, then that person will not notice the change.  To test attention, posner's cueing paradigm is utilized.  Change blindness can be detected because of this paradigm.  "
"Attention is our process of focusing on specific stimuli or information and letting others go in the background. One of the types of attention is endogenous attention which is the term that describes purposeful attention like searching for a specific thing in a crowd or listening for a specific sound. You already have it in your head what you are looking for, so the attention comes from within and is thus endogenous. In this process of focusing, sometimes we miss things that seem rather ridiculous upon further inspection. One of these things is a category called change blindness. Change blindness is a failure of selection in space where we miss that certain aspects of something changed. One of the notable researchers into attention is Posner, who developed Posner’s cueing paradigm (people are good at naming things). This paradigm essentially breaks attention into three specific operations that can be summed thusly: turning attention away from the current focal point, moving the attention to a new location, and turning the attention back on at the new location."
"Attention is something we perceive at any given moment in time that our brain is focused on more than something else going on in the same scenario. This is related to change blindness in that sometimes things happen, that we don't focus our attention on, and therefore, don't realize they happen. That is change blindness--something goes on and we don't even realize it. Our notes explain this by using scenes from movies. They show different shots and change little aspects that most people never even notice. That is because our attention is not usually focused on the small, insignificant aspects like that in movies. Endogenous attention comes from previously stored knowledge--you know what you are trying to focus your attention on. Therefore, when looking for something or someone, you have prior knowledge as to what it looks like, so you know what to look for. Posner started this experiment to test to test the components of attention and how location can effect ones attention and if you remove someone from a specific location where they presumed they were, it will affect whatever object it is they are trying to focus on."
"Attention is the ability to focus on information that is being given at that moment. This gives the ability to be able to have conversation and have a response ready when needed. As well as complete task that we want. There are times that our attention is changed or we are trying to play too close of attention. Change blindness is the in ability to see change in a certain situation. This happens when we might be foucing too much. There are time that endogenous attention / controlled attention is taken over. This is when a person is doing a task but something captures their attention to something else and can not finish the task they are doing. How we have come to study these is by the Posner's cueing paradigm this was an experiments that tested the attention span. But one of the biggest problems with it was bordem. This has been recreated to keep the participants more engaged. This has given better and more accurate results. "
"Attention is the ability to focus on some things while ignoring others. Change blindness is missing a change in your visual field. Endogenous attention is controlled attention from the top down processes. Posner's cueing paradigm is a visual cue task that showed the differences between endogenous and exogenous attention. Attention, change blindness, endogenous attention/controlled attention, and Posner's cueing paradigm all fit together by showing that there are two different types of attention, one being Endogenous attention/controlled attention, which were found by the visual cue task that is the Posner Cueing Paradigm. Attention is also linked to change blindness which is when you were focusing all of your attention on a certain thing that something goes missing in your visual field."
"Attention is the action of focusing on one particular thing or stimuli in order to more efficiently understand and absorb the information a person can exhibit endogenous attention in which they have chosen to focus on the thing or situation that currently has their attention or more specifically controlled attention in which a person can chose what stimuli to focus on and in some case what ""distractors"" to ignore. Some times even when one is paying close attention, change blindness can occur in certain situations. This can happen when there have been certain changes or difference that have occurred ( a good example is in movie editing) and the participant watching is unaware of changed in between frames. Attention shifts can be explained in Posner's cueing paradigm in which an expirement that tests attention and spatial reasoning proved to show how damage to the parietial lobe as well as disorders such as ADHD in children affected attention shift in participants. "
"Attention is the active mental participation of an event.  Change blindness is when attention on a specific event prevents the ability to identify external factors.  Endogenous attention / controlled attention is the action of focusing ones attention on something or forcing yourself to pay attention.  Posner's cueing paradigm is the process of naming an item quickly if it is in an anticipated location.  Often times, attention to an event will create change blindness, or the inability to identify the external changes such as learned with posner's cueing paradigm.  The endogenous attention (controlled attention) is so focused-in that when an object is out of the expected range, it is not easily processed."
"Attention is the amount of focus we are given to an object at any given time. Both change blindness and endogenous attention are forms of attention. Endogenous attention is considered top-down attention because it is when you are focusing your attention on something specific based on your prior knowledge of what you are looking for. Change blindness is when there are many major changes going on around us that we are not aware of because that is not what our attention is focused on so we tend to ignore it and not see it. Posner's cueing paradigm is a way to measure attention and attention changes."
"Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a particular aspect of information. That is straight-forward definition of the word attention and if a train of thought was to operate off the strength of  that statement then there is chance the train might be delayed at that station but for a psychologist like Michael Posner that is enough information to set his train of thought into motion. With his train of thought running at full steam Posner devised a cueing pardigm that assesses a person's ability to perform an attentional shift. Posner with his task discovered or to be more accurate validated the notion of being able to shift attention. Great, we have the ability to shift our attention from piece of information to the next and how is that interesting. A similar experiment that is available youtube is a variation of hidden gorilla scenario. Much like Posner's cueing paradigm the viewer is given a set of instruction and has to respond accordingly. The viewer or participant in this scenario is told to count the number of times a player in a specified color pass a ball. This exam is similar to the Posner task only instead of an arrow serving as an valid cue it is the passing of a ball from one person to the next. While the participant is engaged in counting the number of passes a person in a gorilla costume walks across the stage. At the end of the video the viewer is asked to provide the number of passes that happened. When I participated in this experiment I was able to give the correct amount of passes and I saw the gorilla but that was the only portion of experiment that I got correct. At the end of the video it was revealed that not only did the color of the background change but a confederate actually walked off the stage and I did not see any of those events. My failure to notice those changes is what is called change blindness and change blindness occurs because not all of the information in that scenario was attended to. In conclusion Posner's task assesses attentional shift and the monkey business video assess a glitch in attentional shifting."
"Attention is the cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information. Another word that goes along with attention is focus. When paying attention to a visual stimulus, humans are less likely to notice any introduced change. This is known as change blindness. "
"Attention is the humanly process of which one has an understanding of information that is being given. The more attention that is given towards situations enhances the understanding. If one is not paying attention they endure the affects of change blindness which is inability to recognize change in physical aspects of situations. This can also be done if focus is selective and focuses on the most important parts. Something that could also be experienced within attention is the controlled attention that essentially focuses on how processing for new or difficult tasks are forced and less likely to be dual-tasked. Posner's cueing paradigm focuses on attention and analyzes the ability to do so focusing on reactions. This paradigm can aid in the gauging of someones controlled attention with concepts such as change blindness. "
"Attention is the idea that when we process information, we focus more on some information and ignore or inhibit other pieces of information. Change blindness is a great example of this, and it's the theory that we attend more to the information in our visual field and simply ignore everything else, which causes us to be blind to subtle changes. For example, in the change blindness video that we watched during lecture, we were not made aware of the intent of the video until the end, in which we were told that there were nine subtle changes in the video. I didn't notice any of them, until I went back and watched carefully, and even then did not spot all of them. Endogenous attention is sort of the opposite of change blindness. It's a top down process that is internal and controlled attention, in which you are focused on your goals. Poesner's cueing paradigm is en experiment in which the direction of your attention, whether endogenous or exogenous, is tested. It simply tells you where to look for a target, directing your attention to a certain spot, and testing how long it takes you to find the target. The cue can be misleading, telling you to look at X for the target when it shows up elsewhere (controlled attention). It measures how long it takes you to find the target based on where you're cue told you to look. If you were told to look where the target popped up, it didn't take very long (exogenous attention), but if you were mislead and the target pops up elsewhere, you have to pick up and direct your attention to finding the target yourself (exogenous attention)"
"Attention is the notice a person takes to something.  It displays the importance things have to the person.  Endogenous/change attention is when attention is oriented by the desires/goals of the person who is observing, where that person chooses what they want to pay attention to.  Change blindness is the theory that people fail to see major changes that are introduced to an image.  Posner’s cueing paradigm is a test that is used to assess attention and a person’s ability to shift their attention.  It measures eye movement reactions to measure the effects that different cues have on a person’s attention.  This test helps in the study of attention and how attention varies among different people."
"Attention is the process by which some information is enhanced and some information is inhibited. Endogenous attention, or controlled attention, is manipulated by top-down information which then selects which pieces of information are placed under focus. When this controlled attention fails, one is unable to notice certain aspects of the scene in front of them. This is an example of change blindness. Change blindness is the failure to observe physical changes within a scene. In these instances, attention is not drawn to the changes, and they can easily go unnoticed. However, in Posner's cueing paradigm, attention is drawn to a certain target. If the target is in the cued location, people are able to name the target rather quickly."
"Attention is the process in the brain that allows us to focus on one aspect of a situation, while ""tuning out"" the other, unnecessary aspects. In other words, we enhance some information and inhibit other information. While enhancing some aspect of a scene, we may not notice other, incongruent aspects, a phenomenon called change blindness. Change blindness occurs when we inhibit information that is not part of the central interest that we are focused on, and because of that inhibition, we miss details. We use a type of top down goal setting called endogenous attention to select what aspect of a situation we will focus our attention on. For example, while watching a movie we might be more focused on the actor's faces as they speak rather than the scenery around them and might then miss the actor's shirt changing colors after a cut. We utilize controlled attention for things that are difficult or unfamiliar to us, like driving in a new area. Unlike when we focus our attention and experience change blindness, controlled attention allows us to pay attention to more things simultaneously, which is what occurs when we test Posner's cueing paradigm. Subjects are asked to focus on one thing, then disengage attention and focus on a new thing in a different location. This task, which is more difficult, requires controlled attention. Attention: the process that enhances some information and inhibits other information so that we are able to focus on a specific thing.  change blindness: failure to detect changes in the physical aspects of a scene; ex: the video where many things were changed during cuts. We're ignoring/inhibiting information/not paying attention to it cause we're focused on some other aspect. It is not part of central interest information. Bottom up information can break through our attention (ex: loud noises) while top down goals change what we focus on/what our central interest is. endogenous attention: a voluntary attention process that is top down; it originates from your own thoughts, hence the name. ex: searching a room for all green things while looking for a green item. controlled attention: use this type of processing for difficult or new tasks Posner's cueing paradigm: three separate mental operations: disengaging of attention from the current location, moving attention to a new location and engaging attention in a new location to facilitate processing in that location"
"Attention is the process of enhancing information and inhabiting information. The change blindness is not being able to detect changes in the scene. Endogenous attention is something automatic.  Posner’s cueing paradigm is when a cueing comes up and you have to look for the target. When you are doing a Posner’s cueing paradigm you can see if you are using different attentions. If the cue is in the same spot then you are using an endogenous attention because the cued is in the same location but if it is a mis-cued then you are slower. All of these coincide with one another knowing that one feeds off of the other."
"Attention is the process of focusing on a specific part of your environment or situation you are in and blocking out other parts. An example of this would be if you are super focused while studying you will most likely not notice the different types of drinks people are ordering at the counter. We can control our attention, which is called endogenous attention. This is where we control what we are focusing on such as a book we are reading. Posners cueing paradigm is used to analyze an individuals 3 different types of attention they have. "
"Attention is the process of inhibiting some information, while enhancing the information that one is trying to further process. Essentially, we focus on things we want to process and ignore the things we don’t want to process. An instance where our attention fails us is when we fall prey to change blindness, which is when we miss big changes in our visual field. This occurs because we tend to selectively concentrate on the central interest information governed by our top-down processing. Another instance where we can see our attentions disrupted is shown in the Posner cueing task, an experiment done by Michael Posner. In the experiment, an individual is cued to look in a certain area for a target that will appear. If the target appears on the side that was cued, then automatic processing occurs very quickly; however, when the target appears somewhere that the cue was not directing the individual to look, this is considered a controlled, or endogenous, attention and will take more time to process. Endogenous/controlled attention is a process of attention which occurs in tasks that are challenging and new to an individual so this requires more effort and consideration during these tasks. This attention is internal, which means it is initiated within oneself, and operates using the top-down processing."
"Attention is the process that enhance some information and inhabit other information so it allows us to process things further. Change blindness is the ability to not be able to pick up physical aspects of the scene. So these two relate because so both allow you to pick out what your enhancing in both situations. Endogenous attention is internal and it is controlled attention it is overall controlled by your goals. Posner's cuing paradigm is where you look at a cue in the middle and you can either use controlled or automatic attention because if you have to look in the same place the first target was you used automatic attention but if you have to pick up and move your eyes and look somewhere else you have to controlled attention which shows how they work together."
"Attention is the process that heightens some information while downplaying other information. Endogenous attention is internal, controlled attention that originates based on goals that we may have in a situation. If one is focused on one motive through controlled attention, then it is possible to experience change blindness. Change blindness occurs when we fail to detect changes in the physical aspects of a scene due to our attention being focused on particular aspects. It is also possible to experience speed delays in noticing changes due to attention being focused elsewhere. This is explained by Posner’s cueing paradigm. In this experiment, a cue shows you where to look. Then, a target shows up. If the target is in the same area that the cue was, then people are quick to notice. If the target is far away from the cue, or mis-cues, then the reaction time is slow."
"Attention is the process that, at a given moment, enhances some information and inhibits other information. Change blindness is the failure to detect changes in a physical aspects of a scene. Endogenous attention is an attentional process which has a voluntary, top down aspect. Posner’s Cueing Paradigm is a model for attention that includes three separate mental operations: disengaging of attention; moving attention; and engaging attention in a new location. These terms fit together because they describe the process of how attention is received and divided."
"Attention is the process to focus on some information while ignoring other information. Change blindness is when we do not detect alterations in a scene. Endogenous attention/controlled attention is controlled from within from top down processes. Posner’s cueing paradigm is a visual cueing task that demonstrates the differences between exogenous (uncontrolled) attention and endogenous (controlled) attention."
"Attention is the process, at any given moment, enhances information and inhibits other information. We can choose to pay attention to a specific individual or object and block out surrounding sensory information such as sound. In the change blindness experiment two photos or movies were played and the subject had to pay attention to things that were constantly changing in the photos or movie. Change blindness is the perceptual phenomenon that occurs when the change of visual stimulus is introduced and changed, but the observer does not notice the change. Our attention is affected and we tend to fail to notice major differences  when the image is introduced and changed. Endogenous attention is our attention that comes within, much like top down processing. For example, if i were to enter a room, and was specifically or voluntarily looking for a red truck, I would look for anything and everything red in the room. This is an example of a goal - driven, or top down attention. These forms or processing can be either automatic or controlled attention. For example for medial or easy task our brains will use automatic processing, and for more specific or new task, we would be using controlled processing or attention. In Posner's cueing paradigm, subjects performance in detecting a target is normally better when the target is presented at the cued location rather than when the target is presented at an unqued location. Our attention is focused on the qued location and we expect it to be there. When it is presented in a different location we tend to have more trouble detecting the target. Posner's paradigm shows that visual attention changes the density of information focused at both locations, but does not change the quality of processing at each location. "
"Attention is the way that information is enhanced or inhibited. While sometimes we think we pay attention to everything there are certain things we do not attend to. This reminds me of the experiment we did in class over change blindness. Change blindness is the inability and failure to detect physical changes in a scene. In the experiment we did over change blindness I did not notice any of the changes, this helped me in understanding what exactly change blindness was. Endogenous attention would be when you focus on one thing specifically and you can control it. You may be in a room full of distracting things but only looking for one thing in particular such as a certain color. This can be somewhat explained by Posners cueing paradigm. If someone is given a certain thing to focus their attention on it can be very easy for them to find that target such as being told to look for a specific color in a room. "
"Attention is us processing outside information and we pay more attention to incoming information because we are wanting to use it to and focus on it. Change blindness is not being able to notices changes in things. Endogenous attention is thinking about actions we will do such as riding a bike and controlled attention is not being able to ignore things such as a firework going off. Posner's cueing paradigm is there are three separate mental processes we do. The first is we lose our attention from something. The second is paying attention to something else. The third is paying attention to a whole other new thing. How all of these relate is they all involve our attention and processing whatever it may be we are focusing on. An example I will use is riding a bike. To begin I am paying attention to this new fancy red bike, because for example I really like the color red so it has my attention. I am so drawn in by the color red and that bikes are awesome I don't notice the faint pink pen stripe marks on the bike that equal change blindness. I then think about me riding the bike the wind in my hair and how much fun it is that equals endogenous attention. I then decide to ride the bike and as I am riding it I hear a car horn that is when controlled attention comes into play. Posner's cueing paradigm can be described as me playing basketball and then all of a sudden I see this awesome red bike and it has my attention. I then notice the pink pen stripes and think well thats odd and clashes and that is the second part I move my attention to something else. Then the third I decide to get on the bike my attention is making sure the seat is high enough for me and it feels like the perfect fit."
"Attention is very important in our day to day life and things can slip through the crack if we aren't careful. When we focus our attention on something we enhance some information and ignore other things. Sometimes the things we ignore or the things that fall through the crack are considered change blindness. An example would be looking through a dirty room quickly for an object, being attentive to what we see, missing things in our change blindness and the endogenous attention aspect of using previous knowledge of the room to help by tracking down the object. To which we use Posner's cueing paradigm to explain this top down processing. "
"Attention is what allows us to focus on certain information over other information that is given, that is taking note of something or selecting something over another thing due to its importance. However, occasionally attention fails or blocks out detail. Change blindness is a term that can be defined as the failure to notice characteristic differences in our visual field. Sometimes our attention can be so focused on one aspect of the visual field, known as the central interest, that it completely misses a major detail elsewhere in the visual field. Change blindness can be explained through divided or focused attention. Focused attention means that we are so focused on one aspect that other important features are missed. In divided attention, we are not focused enough on a scene or space that we simply miss details due to a lack of attentiveness or concentration. Divided attention is very common in everyday life. It is not often that someone puts their full undivided attention into something. While attention can sometimes be negative or fail to notice all aspects of a situation, this same concept makes attention positive and resourceful. Endogenous attention is an internally controlled process that allows one to focus on a specific detail or help complete a task. So while change blindness blocks details out, endogenous attention concentrates on a detail, both of which are top down processes. Endogenous attention can be broken through exogenous attention, which does not come from within, and breaks or shifts the endogenous attention. This concept is shown through Posner’s cueing paradigm. Posner’s cueing task showed the difference between endogenous and exogenous attention by recording the response and reaction time to shifting eyes based on the type of cue that was shown. Visual attention shifts vary in reaction time depending on the cue, which differentiates endogenous and exogenous attention. Posner’s cueing also helped identify possible damage in the brain based on the amount of time it took the eyes to shift."
"Attention is when we are consciously aware of something and we remain alert enough to focus on it and comprehend that it is occurring. Change blindness means that we have failed to notice changes that have taken place. We may think that we had been paying attention, but yet we may miss changes within a setting. This failure occurs because we are only paying attention to certain aspects, and ignoring many others. Endogenous attention is considered to be a top-down processing method, which means that it comes from your own knowledge and experiences. It also means that you can be easily distracted from the task. Posner's cueing paradigm is a way to recognize attention based on the participant's reaction times to given cues within the experiment. "
"Attention is when we notice something. Change blindness is when we only pay attention to one thing and not its surroundings. Endogenous attention is goal-driven and controlled attention is stimulus driven. Posner's cuing paradigm is used to assess attention. It has been used to test the effects of disorders and brain injury on attention."
"Attention is when you select and process information. When looking at attention, we notice it can be easily swayed or you can be focusing on certain formation but not the rest of the information. To test this theory we can do something called posners cueing paradigm. This paradigm, is when a object shows up and it can be in two different spots. The observer then says whether or not it was in the specific location. Change blindness is involved in this because this is when visual change happens and the observer doesn't notice. Because of the rapid change within the paragrim, we can see that edogenous attention is disrupted. The change of stimulus makes the observer not notice the change."
"Attention refers to how we process certain information in our environment. Change blindness is a event that occurs when someone is unable to perceive visual changes in the environment. Endogenous attention is a form of attention in which top-down information drives the selection of information on the input. Posner's cueing paradigm is a test that often gets used to assess attention. These terms fit together because Posner's cueing paradigm would be used to assess the endogenous attention. The change blindness would fit in because it would occur someone to not perceive the attention they would get if they were able to process the information."
"Attention seems simple when you originally hear it defined, but there is a lot more to it than just what you are focusing on. That is the most basic definition of attention: our process of focusing on certain information and not on others. It allows us to choose between what's important and needs to be processed and what can be discarded. Attention can be broken down into many facets, such as endogenous or exogenous attention. If you are walking through a busy street with many people on it but choose to focus on a hot dog vendor a block away as opposed to the crowd, you are using endogenous attention, or top-down or voluntary. It can be distracted by stimuli in the environment that steal attention, at which point the attention is considered exogenous. Attention is not fallible, however, as proved by the ability of stimuli to steal it. It can also fail to pick up changes in an environment, called change blindness. Change blindness is most commonly seen in movies when continuity errors occur, such as when the windows in the first Spiderman magically repair themselves after being shattered. Most people have a hard time noticing such things unless it is pointed out to them. Another popular example of change blindness is gorilla videos, which prompt participants to count passes of a ball between people, while a bunch of stimuli is happening around them. In the middle of all this a person in a gorilla suit walks through the scene, and commonly people don't see the gorilla! Studies such as the gorilla studies have been conducted for many years regarding attention. One such study was Posner's cueing paradigm. In this study, it was found that if cued, attention could be directed to a target quickly. However, if they are miscued, they are much slower to direct attention in the correct direction. These findings allowed Posner to distinguish between the three mental operations of attention: disengaging of attention, movement of attention to a new location, and engaging attention to that area. "
"Attention us very important when we are driving or watching children. This is where our attention might be on our phone call, and be blocking out the children in the background that are being noisy. Change Blindness might be hard for someone that has their attention on the cell to notice that the noisy children have gotten quite, the next step would be endogenous/controlled attention and this is from within you. Where you are searching for a specific type of information such as noise from children playing in the background, and then we go to see why they have become quite. This is part of Posner’s Cueing Paradigm and this is where a person can say a name or word if they are cured for it, much like when you yell for your child to come here because the lack of noise coming from their room."
"Attention:  focusing on specific features, locations, or objects or on certain thoughts or activities. Change blindness:  difficulty in detecting changes in similar, but slightly different, scenes that are presented one after another. Endogenous attention:  occurs when a person consciously decides to scan the environment to find a specific stimulus or monitor what is happening. All of these terms have to deal with attention and visual perception.  They are all about what we notice around us and what we remember about our surroundings.  Did you notice the person across the room drop their pen? did you notice the creepy looking dog around the corner? Attention is the term that fits into all other terms as they all have to deal with attention, but they are all intertwined. These terms make up the Posner's cueing paradigm.  "
"Attention: The ability to focus on one object or stimuli while being able to ignore another."
"Attentions is both a behavioral and cognitive process of only concentrating on certain information, while ignoring the rest. Change blindness is when something is introduced into the visual field, but the viewer does not notice. The viewer was only paying attention to one aspect of the view and ignored the rest. Endogenous Attention, also called controlled attention, is when attention is voluntarily controlled. The viewer is directed toward the target and thus, like in the Change Blindness experiment, the viewer only pays attention to the target and nothing around it. The Posner Cueing Paradigm is a test that assesses how someone can handle an attentional shift. An attentional shift would be like going from an endogenous to the opposite exogenous attention. For example in the change blindness test, after the person misses the addition of new material because their brain is ignoring it, the interviewer may point that material out and the person would not miss it the next time, but may miss something else. "
"Autism Brain Research is a type of brain research that studies the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many children are affected by this terrible biological condition, and the effects of this disorder alters so many lives forever. With this disorder people struggle to communicate and develop social relationships. An example of this type of research would be researching autism like behaviors in mice and looking for such behaviors as repetitive grooming or anxiety. You could study about the effects of switching on and off genes related to ASD, and monitor whether or not they reverse any of the ASD behaviors. Some people wonder if some ASD behaviors are reversible as people get older."
"baumann 1. Sensation is the raw input coming into the sensory cortex which helps us gather information to understand the environment. Perception is the interpretation of what we sense in order to figure out what is out there and where it is. The different roles between them are essential to study because they each combine to form the ways we process information. Sensation allows us to visually process information but is practically meaningless without perception, which allows us to mentally process and interpret the information and give meaning to it. It allows us to conquer being mislead by optical illusions and to recognize familiar objects. For example, when viewing an image of a road, our sense of sight only sees the lines of the road ending in the middle of the page, our perception however allows us to make sense that the road is continuing due to our intellect and prior knowledge."
"baumann 4. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, the study of cognitive psychology first started in Wihelm Wundt's laboratory in 1879 in Leipsig, Germany in order to understand the nature of consciousnes, mainly on the ways in which sensations are combined in how we percieve an entire object. Wundt's approach on sensations and feelings were then further extended by a student of his, Edward Titchener, who further researched all mental activity beginning with its basic operations and further leading to methods for assessing mental activity."
"baumann 5. Embodied cognition is the idea that the brain region that is activated when a person is performing a procedural action is also activated in the same manner as when a person is only imagining the procedure. For instance, the region responsible for speech production, Broca's area, is activated when a person sings to him/herself and, according to the idea of embodied cognition, is also activated when a person has the song stuck in his/her head. "
"baumann 6. In the Pattern Change experiment, a simple visual search task was given in which individuals were measured on their accuracy for finding a target letter when surrounded by either similar or dissimilar backgrounds in the matter of five seconds. The experiment was a within group design since each participant was exposed to both levels of the independent variable, which was type of background, either being similar or dissimilar. The dependent variable was the individual's ability of visualling finding the particular letter, measured by writing down the letter to the target letter's right, or putting a dash if unable to find it. Since it was a within subject experiment, the entire class was the experimental group, and there was no control group."
"baumann 7. The frontal lobe would be the worst to break. An injury to the brain's largest lobe would essentially change a person completely of who they are. It controls motor skills, conscious thought, memory, emotions, motivation, judgment, decision making, problem solving ability, and personality. Ultimately a break to this lobe would affect all aspects of behavior, mood, and personality, and I could not imagine being unaware of who my family or friends are, and who I am for that matter."
"baumann 8. The Meuller-Lyer illusion is a size and constancy illusion. It demonstrates how we interpret the whole picture due to gestalt principles by comparing it to surrounding objects that cause it to look bigger, thus altering our linear perspective due to the size constancy effects."
"baumann 9. Survey maps contain the general knowledge of spatial structure in the environment and are route independent. It is used in daily life when trying to go from Point A to Point B, such as your house to Walmart. If a road is blocked off, you know your way around and do not have to depent on a GPS to direct you which street to turn on next. However, if moving to a new location, then an individual may rely more on a route map to get around until they become more familiar with the spatial arrangement. "
"baumann Attention is the cognitive process of concentrating on a particular aspect while ignoring other percievable information. Furthermore, we select particular information to focus on and ignore the rest. Not all available information is attended because we normally pay attention to stimuli that is relevant or meaningful, which is proven by the phenomenon known as change blindness. Change blindness occurs when an observer fails to selectively attend to all information in his/her visual field and therefore fails to notice changes that occur right in front of them. Despite many of the failure of selections, the successes of selectively attention allows us to efficiently select relevant information when needed, such as finding your friends in a crowd based on your memory of the clothes they were wearing. This attentional process is considered endogenous attention because it is goal-driven and originates from within an individual's own knowledge. It is voluntary, and therefore can be overridden by salient and powerful stimuli. When attention is re-directed by salient and powerful stimuli like glass shattering, is considered exogenous attention. In order to understand the influences of endogenous and exogenous cues on information processing, researchers have conducted many experiments. Posner's cueing paradigm demonstrates the affects of endogenous cues on an individual's ability to perform an attentional shift, in which he found that observers detect a target better when it is present at the cued location than when the target appears at the uncued location. "
"baumann Cognitive psychology is the study of the mind and mental acitvity, but was first exclusively focused on the level of information processing. The cognitive process of how we internally acquire, process, and store information was first tied into the development of the computer. Researchers used the computer as a model to understand how mental activity works in humans. Also known as artificial intelligence, this system models the mind and performs cognitive tasks similar to humans, which allows researchers to understand the internal mechanisms linked with behavior. Similarly to how artifical intelligence has the capability of processing and storing information with the use of software and hardware, humans have a information processing system based on the mind and brain's connection. This mind-brain connection is the complex relationship between the brain's ability to acquire and store information and the mental activity that interprets this information into a mental representation. Researchers have further conducted experiments to fully understand mental processing. By manipulating particular variables it enables us to observe the outcomes and further advance in the understanding of attention, language, memory, perception, decision-making and other cognitive processes.  "
"baumann The feature-matching thoery suggests that we are capable of recognizing stimuli based on the critical features that it possesses by matching them against features stored in memory. It may seem so simplistic that one would think it solely depends on bottom up processing since we are identifying a stimulus based on it's distinct features from the external environment that we recognize from our memory. However, the feature-matching theory of word recognition also demonstrates the effects of top down processing, which is determined by internal knowledge, beliefs, goals, and expectations that essentially influences our perceptions. This is because network models have interacting levels of represenation and therefore higher levels are capable of influencing information at earlier stages. In recognizing words, our perception of a target letter can be manipulated based on surrounding letters, known as the word superiority effect. The feature net model detects a particular letter based on its specific features, but if our visual environment is affected and parts of the word are covered up, it becomes difficult to detect the specific features. Top down processing comes in handy by allowing us to use our internal knowledge and expectations to identify the only possible words that can be made up of the certain letters. Behavioral studies have discovered that individuals are better at recognizing a briefly flashed letter when shown in the context of a full word rather than the single letter itself. This demonstrates how our perception is normally based on a combination of top down and bottom up processing. "
"baumann The Mexican Wave is a demonstration of how sequential action of structures creates the movement of other structures through communication, similar to the electro-chemical process of neurons in action. When individuals in a stadium try to get the ìwaveî going, they must have good communication in order for the process to work correctly. Likewise, neurotransmitters send messages across a synapse from one neuron to another. Just like how people pass on the message by briefly standing and throwing up their hands, electrical and chemical signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another in order for the next neuron to process and transmit information. The ìwaveî of people jumping up and shouting demonstates the action potential occuring between cells. The neurotransmitter responds to this action potential by being released and moving across the synapse and binding with receptors to keep the communication ongoing. Neurotransmitters are primarily produced in the cerebrum, which containsfour lobes that accommodate groups of neurons that do specific tasks. The Frontal lobe is in control of muscle movements and responses that it recieves from the hypothalamus and is associated with the neurotransmitter dopamine. A deficiency of dopamine involves a lack of attention and also affects our working memory. In the rearmost part of the lobe is the motor area, controlling voluntary movement, and on the left frontal lobe is an area considered Broca's area, which controls speech production. A person suffering from Broca's aphasia is unable to recall words and has jumbled speech creating difficulty with communicating. If nearby motor-control regions are also damaged this can lead to right side physical disabilities. "
"Because attention has to do with focusing on one stimulus while ignoring another, this can often cause change blindness because we so concerned with a central area of interest that miss small changes our mind deemed unimportant. This kind of focused attention is considered to be endogenous attention. This attention can be seen in Posner's Cueing paradigm because the participant should be focused on the specific center object (cross, X). When another stimulus is flashed on the screen the participant's reaction time is monitored, showing exogenous attention. However, it is entirely possible for the participant to miss the stimuli flashed due to overattention and thus change blindness. "
"Because sensation and perception are two different things entirely, we study the difference between them. Our sensations are constantly coming into our brain to process. We then choose which sensations we want to perceive. So basically, we view and sensate things and then choose how to perceive them. I can see someone on the side of the road that is holding up a sign saying they need money, food, etc. However, I choose how I want to perceive that scenario. They could be homeless, not able to work, and in need. They could also be completely capable of getting a job and making money to provide for themselves and not ask someone else for it. "
"Before there was psychology, there was philosophy. Through philosophy, psychology was formed. Major psychology beginnings started with Wundt and his school of thought. He and his student Titchener relied too much of introspection. As a response to his work, behaviorism developed as a reaction to these unobservable mental tasks. This shift was a movement from philosophical approach to a measurable, scientific approach; however, this was focused primarily on behavior. As a response to behaviorism, cognitive psychology was born. Cognitive psychology has its start in research alongside of the advances in computer science. This helped to understand the brain by thinking of it like a computer."
"Behavioral brain research measures observable behavior directly, then inferences are made about how the brain might process a response to the behavior. One method used in this typ eof research is called judgements. In this method, a person may be asked to rate an interview or how well a class went on a specified scale. An advantage to this is that the data is easy to collect but it also has its limitations. The participant may not be honest or they may not understand the scale given to them and fill it out incorrectly."
"Behavioral brain research measures observable behavior directly, then inferences are made about how the brain represents and processes the direct behavior responses. One method used in behavioral brain research is called Judgement. In this method, a person is asked to rate how they felt about a class or interview on a specified scale. It is easy to collect data from this kind of method but it does have its limitations. The participant may not be honest on the rating they give ot they may not understand the scale that was given to them."
"Behavioral method measures directly observable behaviors, such as the time to respond or the accuracy of a response. An example of this type of research is me going to an job interview and the interviewer is asking me a question regarding me knowing the expectations of the job and I answer the question in a good time frame whether I knew the expectations or not. "
"Behavioral research measures behavior that can be observed; researchers draw conclusions about internal representation from observations of behavior. An example of behavioral research is memory recall. Memory recall measures accuracy, as determined by the percentage of answers one gets correct and the percentage one does not. "
"Behavioral studying of the brain is the most interesting view to me. How can we really study the brain, by not watching exactly how one performs in situations? Behavioral methods are based on studying the direct reactions and actions made. This can be based on time response, level of response, how someone determines to respond, etc. More specifically, someone can take a class, be given a huge amount of information, and then an hour later, be asked to recall what they remembered from said lecture. No notes aloud. This would be memory recall and a direct way of studying the behavioral side of the brain. "
"Bottom up and top down processing are two ways in which people form perceptions of things around them. In bottom up processing, our perceptions are influenced by stimuli. If you were to look at an object we had never seen before, you would not have any preconceived idea of what the object is supposed to look like. Therefore, you would rely on the data input of the stimulus to form your perception of the object and thus engage in bottom up processing. This bottom down approach of putting together details until a larger picture is formed is basis of a recognition theory known as feature mapping. Feature matching theory is the idea that when looking at an object, it has certain characteristic features (these features could be color, form etc. and depend on the type of object) that we match to features that have been kept in our memory. Each of these individual features combine to form unique objects, thus a bottom down approach is applied to form a perception of what objects are. In contrast, top down processing actually requires you to use your background knowledge in order to form perceptions. So when people start with a larger concept and then work their way into more detailed information about it, top down processing is occurring. Important to the context of top down processing is the word superiority effect. This effect is based on our ability to better recognize letters within words than when they are alone or in word contexts that do not make sense. This phenomenon helps to explain why people are able to quickly read words that are scrambled or misspelled because they have expectations of how the word should look (hence, background knowledge required for top down processing)."
"Bottom up processing and top down processing are each a pathway that sensations take in our brain in order to interpret the given information. Bottom up processing is at the ""feature level,"" meaning it uses bits and pieces in order to make sense of the information. This process is supported by Gestalt psychologists, who study grouping and perceptions. The feature matching theory says that your brain will look at something and break it down into recognizable parts that it knows already. It uses feature detectors, which are neurons or groups of neurons found in the brain, that learn to recognize certain objects, movements, shapes, and other given pieces of information based on simple characteristics. This theory is good because it doesn't use a lot of storage space in the brain. On the other hand, top down processing involves taking sensory information and interpreting it at the ""contextual level."" This process uses heuristics, which are ways to solve problems in a faster manner, compared to lengthy, complicated algorithms. The top down process relies heavily on our expectations of shapes, color, and size of objects. The word superiority effect supports the top down idea. It's explained that humans recognize letters when they're put into words, rather than individually or in made-up words."
"Bottom up processing is a way of processing information in which the data from the environment is primarily obtained through the senses. Another type of processing, top down processing occurs when perceptions are influenced by information in the environment as a context for understanding. Like with the top down approach, feature matching theory also uses other information as context, however, this context information is from memory, not from the environment. Word superiority effect is describes as being able to recognize letters with in recognizable words in a higher rate than unrecognizable word. The additional letters in the recognizable words provide a context for processing the information, like with top down processing and feature matching. "
"Bottom up processing is a way that our brain interprets new information by integrating parts of it into a whole. We use this type of processing when the information presented is not like that which we know or expect and we have to find some way to efficiently understand it. One such theory that uses bottom up processing is feature matching theory. Feature matching theory attempts to explain how we come to associate things to be those things in our brain, as well as categorize different things into groups. For example, when we look at a human, some of the features we may notice is being bipedal, having two arms, rounded ears on the sides of the head, hair of varying length on top of the head and potentially a small amount of hair around the mouth, chin, and under the nose, and varying types of clothing on the body. We are flexible though, and we have come to assimilate into our understanding that a human may also be in a wheelchair, have crutches, have a cast, be bald or clean shaven, or missing limbs. The combination of those things lead us to see a human instead of an animal or some other organism. Top down processing is the opposite of that. With top down processing, we use our prior knowledge to understand the information that we are being given by our environment. We do this to process information faster and more efficiently. If we see an ambulance in the distance with its lights on, our top down processing skills engage and we expect it to be about the size of ambulances we have seen in the past, regardless of its current appearance in time, we expect the lights to be very bright and for there to be an injured person heading to the hospital, we expect that it will have some kind of markings signifying that it is an emergency vehicle for some medical facility, and we expect it to be going fast, people to be pulling over, and it to be able to go through red lights. In the event that this doesn’t actually happen, we will use bottom up processing in an attempt to make sense of it. One great example of top down processing is word superiority. Word superiority describes the way that our brains use top down processing to read words, even if the words are not exactly spelled right or the letters are not exactly shaped correctly. We have an expectation of how the words are spelled, what they look like, and what they mean. That expectation makes us want to identify words even if the letters are jumbled or are not shaped optimally, like in a captcha for security on a website."
"Bottom up processing is how our outside environment effects us. Everyones environment is different this leads others to interpret items different compared to each other. The Top down processing is similar and bottom down processing is driven by our own personal goals and what our personal beliefs maybe. This is usually in grained in us by our parents. Word superiority is be able to change the target of words or size of shape due to leaving parts out of covering it up. With bottom up processing and top down we are able to guide our minds and vision with what we might see due to those process put together. Feature matching theory is similar to these. It plays on what we know already. It helps us be able to look at familiar object and images that are not whole and be able to come up with an image that is familiar to us. "
"Bottom up processing is how we sense things that comes from the outside world. Top down processing helps us perceive the information coming to us based on who we are. Word superiority is how we distinguish between letters, and words. Feature matching theory helps is identify shapes, and similar characteristics of objects.How all these relate is I think it starts with bottom down processing because this is the first step to processing information. The second step is top down processing determining what we make of the information we are receiving. Then  depending on what it is we are perceiving either word superiority theory will come into play or feature matching theory will. If we are reading something then word superiority would come next and we identify what the words were by the letters. If we were looking at a blackout figure of an octopus for example we would know that the tenticles and shape of the head resembles more of a octopus than an jellyfish for example and this would be feature matching theory that would come into play."
"Bottom up processing is when we use the subject  at hand and our senses to gain a perception in it. The feature matching theory is a kind of bottom up process. The theory says that you mentally look for similar features that you can tie together into what your mental visual of what that you mentally visualize that object to be. For example, if I see something rectangular and fluffy, I can gather that is a pillow. Top down processing uses the information that we know from past experiences to gain perception on the subject. Word superiority is a top down processing example. That is when people can remember words that they read better than a single letter of a word. We percieve based on our assumptions. "
"Bottom up processing relates to sensory. Specifically, this deals with grouping principles and depth processing. The feature matching theory is the idea that everything has to have certain characteristics. All of these are happening at once. This theory proves to be economical for the brain as there is less storage space. Your sensory organs expect something to have certain characteristics. Top-Down processing is controlled by context information and heuristics. Heuristics are short-cuts or rules for how to make sense of the world. Word Superiority is the idea that you can still read words even if it is misspelled or the letters are scrambled. This is because we expect that next word to occur. Feature Matching Theory goes along with Bottom-Up processing, while the word superiority effect does with top-down processing. All of these are ways to make sense of the world around us. "
"Bottom-up processing and top-down processing are opposite terms. Bottom-up processing means that the information in our brain comes from the sensory information derived from the world around us. Top-down processing is different because this information comes from our current knowledge and beliefs. The feature-matching theory affects the way that we perceive objects by using characteristics that we can relate back to objects. Using word superiority, we know that words are important to us and we are able to recognize words based on the way that words physically look. We may notice the different slants or circles used in our alphabet."
"Bottom-up processing and top-down processing are two ways our brain receives information from the world and makes sense of it.  When we utilize bottom-up processing the sensory information is being processed and used, while context information is the driving force behind top-down processing.  One's knowledge, expectations, and previously learned concepts influence top-down processing, whereas bottom-up processing focuses completely on the stimuli and allows the stimulus to determine the final perception.  These two types of processing are used interchangeably within our brain and we don't even recognize which one we are using.  Edge detectors and bar detectors are utilized when processing information from the world around us.  Edge detectors allow us to assume information about things without fully engaging in them.  An example of this would include word superiority effect, which states that a letter is more recognizable when it is surrounded by other letters rather than standing alone.  The surrounding letters of a certain letter in a word allow us to perceive a word without having to completely read the word.  Feature matching theory is a theory that can be related to bottom-up processing because this theory allows us to search for important, but simple characteristic features of an object. "
"Brain imaging:  techniques such as functional MRI and PET that result in images of the brain that represent brain activity.  Brain imaging while used in several types of research is most used in cognitive research where activity is measure in response to specific cognitive tasks. When using brain imagine scientists can see what part of the brain is working while we complete and/or think about certain tasks, therefore helping learn more about the brain and how it functions.  This also helps with treatment when it come to the brain mental disabilities. "
"Brain research is based on the aspects of illness to the brain, one mental research is mental stimulus and this is done because researchers are always wanting and needing to be able to see if treatment is working or other type of treatment needs to be done and get a more in dept diagnosis and create different treatments. The stimuli is something that will change in the internal or external enviroment the external is called sensitivity."
"Cognitive Psychology is the study of the thinking mind. Scientists were curious about how the mind functions or works to form thought and different functions in the human brain. Cognitive research has many applications because the research can tell us many things about everyday life, because after all it is the study of what makes us human in our own minds. Experiments helped scientists study and research theories in cognitive psychology to look for causal relationships between phenomenon. Some experimental methods help assess functions in the brain or mind to demonstrate a phenomenon. Along with our own curiocity with our own minds, people have developed artificial intelligence, which is when a computer that tries to simulate the mind. Artificial intelligence aimes to act like a person would, at least their mind. An example of artificial intelligence would be a smart phone. In relationt to AI,  mind brain connection theory sort of asks if the mind is the software and the brain is the hardware. The theory asks if the mind and brain are separate and in the theory the brain is thought to ìrunî the body by psyciological sensations and that thinking comes from the mind. This theory has not been very controversial in recent times but comes up when a person is in a coma or vegetative state because the brain does not seem to  be functioning but those who come out of the coma say they knew people were speaking to them."
"bridenbaugh Although philosophers had been writing about cognition long before, cognitive psychology really started in Germany in 1879 with Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt focused on understanding the nature of consciousness. Introspection was relied on heavily, which is the process of internal perception. "
"bridenbaugh Attention is the process that, takes in and further processes some information while sets aside other information. Attention allows us to focus more on a certain stimuli or information taken in and set aside other information that may not be as important. Because some information is set aside, when the brain is inundated with information it might not notice a large amount of information. Because a large amount of information is missed or put aside, it can lead to a failure to detect changes in physical aspects of a scene. This is known as change blindness. Change blindness can occur in scenarios such as a watching movie. While the brain subconciously focuses on some information more than others, it can also focus or search for some specific information from its knowledge. This is called endogenous attention because it comes from central interest that the brain is actively looking for. Oppositely, exogenous attention occurs when the brain picks up an interest in information or stimuli generated from the environment. This situation could be a loud noise, something breaking, or a strong color that would draw focus to the stimuli. One test often used to assess attention, would be the Posner cueing paradigm. The paradigm tests an individual's ability to shift their attention. In the paradigm, participants are infront of a computer where they are told to focus on a part of the screen marked by an ìX' or a dot. There are two boxes on either side of the point and the mark is removed briefly and an object appears in one of the boxes where the particpant must indicate immediately."
"bridenbaugh in the brain, neutotransmitters are chemmicals that transmit signals across a synapse (or space between neurons) from one neuron to another neuron. The chemicals are released from axon terminals to the dendrites of another neuron. The dendrites catch the message and decide whether or not the action potential reaches the treshhold to send the message through. The Mexican Wave is a tool to help understand this communication between neurons in the brain. The wave is sort of a visualizaiton of how the communication moves across the neurons. If one imagines ìthe waveî happening at a sporting event, the same type of motion occurs from neuron to neuron. The message that each neuron sends moves from dendrites who ìcatchî the message from across a snyapses, moves the message across the neuron axon and to the axon terminals who send the message to the next neuron. In the area of the brain know as the frontal lobes, functions such as abstract thinking, attention, and speech production are controled. Included in the frontal lobes is the primary motor cortex which is loacated at the back of the frontal lobe and controls movement from neurons conntected to different parts of the body. The neurons send messages to ìmove left armî or other movements. On the front of the frontal lobe, the  prefrontal cortex controls attention systems with abstract thinking and focus. Included in the frontal lobe is Broca's area, usually on the left side of the brain in correspondance with the dominanat hemisphere, functions in speech production. Language processing is associated with Broca's area where one would think of what to respond in conversation. Broca's is thought of a speech production area."
"bridenbaugh Our brain is pretty neat when speaking about perception or sensation. Sometimes perception driven by features or context. Bottom up processing means perception is driven by sensation or features. Sensory input or stimuli drive the perception. Small sensations build a bigger picture that the brain puts together. An example would be a spider in a room. You see the spider and the information from your visual cortex takes in the stimuli to your brain and your brain puts together where the spider is in the room. Oppositely, top down processing means everything is driven by the context of the situation and the brain makes use of information that it already has from sensory systems. It is a cognitive process that starts with thoughts and then flows down to lower level functions, like senses. An example of top down processing would be criticaly reading the context of writing. When writing the brain even over processes information and will actually read a misspelled word as it should be spelled, this is called word superioroity effect. Your brain wants to read the words as it expects them to be spelled so it recognizes the words as spelled correctly. When recognizing an object or perception, the brain can also analyze an object for features or characteristics that it recognizes from a familiar object, this is called feature matching.The brain collects many attributes at the same time and then put it together to try to match the object in a parallel fashion."
"bridenbaugh Sensation and Perception are studied because we want to know how our world is made up in our minds. The ways that we use sensations to create a mental picture of how the world around us works is very interesting. Sensation and perception are different because sensation is the input or raw data that the brain receives. Perception is what the brain makes out of the input that it receives, or interpretation. The distinction is important because the input and interpretation are two different functions. In works of art two people could see totally different conclusions. One person could see an object as a dog and another person may see that object as a shrub. "
"bridenbraugh A hollow face illusion is a misinterpreted depth cue, such as the dragon in the notes. We think that the face is coming towards us but it is not moving. "
"bridenbraugh Behavioral research of the brain uses behavior methods to measure directly observeable behavior. Researchers try to draw inferences about internal representation from the responses they observe. A type of behavioral research would be accuracy method. In the method memory recall is tested to observe processing effectiveness. "
"bridenbraugh Embodied cognition emphasizes the role the enironment plays in the development of cognitive processes. The idea is that the environment in relation with our bodies plays a role in cognition. This can be seen with a baseball player moving to catch a pop fly in the field. The player must take into account the ball moving and their brain must piece together where their body needs to be to catch the ball. "
"bridenbruagh In my opinion the frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to break. I think it would be the worst to break because it has everything to do with intelligence and also movement. The ability to communicate could also be lost if the Broca's area was broken. The frontal lobe also is important in retaining long term memories. If the frontal lobe is damaged people sometimes don't act like themselves or lost their personality which would be very hard to over come. People don't know how to respond in situations or can't express the correct emotion in a given situation."
"Broca's area- located in frontal lobe, vital speech area. "
"Broca's Area: Located in the frontal lobe, controls our ability to produce coherent speech. "
"brown Cognitive psychology started in Germany by William Wundt. He headed the first modern psychology laboratory, in Leipzig, Germany. Cognitive psychology began to be researched more one the development of the computer came around and you were able to record the mind process. "
"brown Each of the four lobes are important to us in major ways so losing one would no matter what would not be good for you.  One lobe I feel that would be the worst to lose would be the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe, I feel like, plays so many roles in your everyday life.  To name just a few, muscle movements, your speech/language (Broca's), controls your attention (, and abstract thinking (primary motor cortex.) There are many ways on which I believe this would be the worst to lose. First, say you were a star athlete and your sport was your life, its what you live everyday, and you were to damage your frontal lobe, they would be saying goodbye to the one thing they love. Without the frontal lobe they wouldn't be able to speak with their teams mates and coach, would have trouble thinking about what to do, and the most vital part would be that they would not be able to move and play their sport. For any average everyday person, like myself, losing that lobe would make my world completely different not being about to basically interact with my friends and family and live the life that I grew up knowing and loving. Overall, the frontal lobe would play a major life changer in my opinion."
"brown Embodied cognition is the act of imagining something creates the same brain activation as actually doing the activity itself. An example could simple be something that you are so used to doing that its just natural to you to do, like tying a shoe or playing the piano, you can't explain them but you can visually see it in your mind. An example that the power points show is singing to yourself, connecting with Brocas. There are two studies that are done to test embodied cognition one would be the Baseball Theory and another would be the Typing Theory. The Baseball Theory is where pro baseball players were asked to predict their batting performances and were put into a fake hitting simulator, like a wii video game. Product of this test shows that the baseball players weren't very good at guessing their performance levels because they have no physical feedback. "
"brown One of the illusions that we discussed in class was the gardener dragon. This illusion is a hallow face illusion that gives you the illusion that you are looking at a statue of a dragon. However, this illusion is not a statue like it appears. This hallow face illusion is giving you the impression that something is 3D when it is not it is flat."
"brown The brain is the most complex area in our body, containing four lobes, the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and temporal lobe and each section of the brain connects its neurons and passes messages the same way. However each lobe is designated to its own grouping of neurons. This process is the process in which each neuron communicates and travels throughout the brain, relaying messages. Even though each lobe of the brain has a certain in which it contributes, process remains the same . Neurotransmitters are the chemical process of communication for neurons, such as dopamine, which travels through the synapse between neurons. Between eat neurotransmitter you go through the Mexican Wave, or action potential. The Mexican wave is an electrical impulse that surges along an axon within a neurons structure. This is caused by an influx of positive ions in the neuron. For every action potential there needs to be a threshold, which is the stimulation needed for action potential to even occur. Action potential occurs in the axon part of the brain and passes through myelin, which can help speed up the process of sending a message. After action potential has been completed neurotransmitters are released and passed along and it begins all over again. Message enters through the dendrites with the input of the information which will go through the cell body to the axon goes through the action potential and then sends the message off through the axon terminals. Each lobe in the brain is made up of a group of neurons which all communicate the same messages for a specific task each lobe of the brain. We have your sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Two lobes in the brain contain special areas that deal with your speech and your hearing. Motor neurons are good example for a vast majority of neurons that you would find in the frontal lobe, which is where you can also find your motor cortex. The frontal lobe is the main part of your brain that controls abstract thinking and movement. Inside the frontal lobe however, we have the Broca's area. The major role of this area is the production of speech, which would make sense on why it is in the lobe that also contains the motor cortex. The Broca's area can be identified in the left hemisphere of your frontal lobe. "
"brown The study of cognition started as a result of behaviorism, which was multiple psychologists who avoided the talk of mental activity. Theories would specify ways that stimuli lead to response. Behaviorism failed to provide any insight into the nature of perception, memory and decision-making. However, they contributed to a group of experimental techniques that were used with cognition.  "
"brown There are multiple ways that you can test attention but we're only going to mention Dichotic Listening Task and Endogenous Tasks. Lets start with Dichotic Listening Task, which its overall aspect is responding to one thing and ignoring others going on. Someone is presented with two messages, one different in each ear. This will be given the person an attended channel and unattended channel, which the unattended channel is the channel that you are supposed to ignore. With early results, people don't recall very much from the unattended message, except maybe pitch (like gender change) and don't typically notice if the language had changed or repetion of words. With later finding, people will without knowing it switch ears to follow the meaning of attended channel.  Second, we have the Endogenous Cueing Task. This task has two boxes appear on a screen, one on the left and one on the right of the fixated point shown by an arrow, the endogenous cue. This arrow leads the person to focus their attention on that location. With this you get valid trail, invalid trials, and neutral trials. Two main results from this are that people detect the target quicker in the valid conditioning that to neutral condition, suggesting attending a location can facilitate processing in that location. The second one is that people detect the target in the invalidly cued location significantly more slowly than neutral. "
"brown There are three types of brain research, one of which is correlational. Correlational research helps to reveal patterns of brain activity and has four different dimensions. Spatial resolution, temporal resolution, invasive, and cost. One method of correlational research is a MRI (magnetic resonance imaging.) MRIs were originally used to assess brain structure, not function. These tests use magnetic fields to alter the orientations or specific atoms in a substance. Process begins with a strong magnetic being turned and lining up all atoms, quick pulses of radio waves is then used to disorient the atoms which give away detectable signals when returning to their normal state. The signals returning are recorded. MRIs are great when it comes to time on the process of recording information and covers a good spatial resolution. However, they are very expensive and the invasive factor is decent (MRIs are very loud.)"
"brown Though the term ìpay attentionî makes enough sense for telling us that we need to focus on something, ignore all other distractions. That is in itself the basically definition of attention, your ability to focus one thing while ignoring all others. Within the aspect of attention you have two roles that come from it, failures of selection and success of selection.  An example of failed selection would be if you were to go to a party or a game and so much is going on at one time that its hard for you to focus on one thing at a time, failure of selection in space. Change blindness is a term used within the failure of selection in space. Change blindness is when you miss a physical change in your visual field. You find a lot of examples in movies, one scene someone might have a full drink and after panning away from that person and then right back it could be empty, or vise versa.  This happens a lot of the time because you may be focused on one thing so much that the rest is irrelevant.If you were to walk into a room and searched quickly and with just something you know if help find something, like if your friend is wear a red jacket or her hair is up in a pony tail, the main thing you would be scanning for are those highlights. This attentional process is called endogenous attention. Endogenous attention is a controlled attention from a top-bottom processing, which is creating a picture of perception based on background knowledge you may have. However, top-down processing can be taken back and distract you from the task you are wanting to achieve. This attention that has captured you attention is best known as exogenous attention and unlike endogenous attention it is from a bottom-up process. Bottom-up being the process of creating a picture of perception based upon your sensory inputs.Posner Cueing Paradigm was a visual like cue task which showed differences between endogenous and exogenous attentions. You would be shown a location to look. Posners study produced two main results. One, participants could detect their target faster in the valid condition compared to a neutral condition. Second, participants detected the target in the invalidly cued location were much slower than the others. "
"brown Two different processes, top-down processing and bottom-up processing can put perception together. Top ñ down processing is when you create a picture of perception based on background knowledge that you already have on something. Bottom-up processing is creating a picture of perception based on a sensory input you have. Both bottom-up and top-down processing product interpretations on things, basically how you see something. Perception seems like it has a lot more to do with the bottom- up process than it does with the top-down. Bottom-up places a lot of roles when comes to your sight, such as light sensitivity and depth perception. Top-down has a very interesting role it plays in, which is word superiority. Word Supruriority is basically the concept of being able to put together pieces that make words. On out power point we were shown an example with a picture that showed two ìwords.î You could have gotten ìcatî and ìtheî out of the picture. The ìHî in the center could have been interpreted as an ìAî but just the top point had been cut off. But with out that piece there your mind would use that top-down process.A theory in perception is the Match Feature Theory (model), which is where we match things based on a set of specific features that are needed for that object. The idea that the processing of the information in the brain is parallel and distributed. Basically, happening at the same time or happening in different neural areas in the brain."
"Broca's area is the part of the brain that processes what a person should do or say in response to what they hear. Broca's area is found in the frontal lobe of the brain. The frontal lobe manages abstract thinking and attention. When a person hears something, the sensation of what was heard must be processed by the brain. To process this sensation, individual nerve cells called neurons send a signal through the brain to the area which process it best, which for determining what action to take based on something heard would be Broca's area. The signal is passed through an electrochemical process, meaning that within a single neuron, it is an electric signal, but the brain uses chemicals called neurotransmitters to send the signal through the synapse, the space between individual neurons. This works in a similar way to the Mexican Wave at a sporting event. One neuron passes the signal to the next, to the next, to the next until the signal has reached the place it needed to go. "
"carrell 1. The difference in sensation and perception is important because different people can perceive something in the same way, even if the sensation is the same. Even one person can perceive the same sensation differently than they have before. For example, when a person's eyes take in light, they see everything they are looking at but their brain processes and perceives only a part of it. Optical illusions are perfect for explaining this. Our eyes are receiving the sensations perfectly, the pictures have not changed, but our perception of them has and so we ìseeî them as being tilted or swirling when they are not. "
"carrell 10. Attention can be tested using a feature search, like the one we used in class with the letters hidden in a field of letters with either similar shapes or different ones. The brain picks up on letters with different features more quickly and accurately than it does letters with similar features to the rest on the screen. Another test for attention is Posner's cueing paradigm to measure that people see things quicker and easier when they are primed to see them instead of having to turn off attention, transfer it, and then turn it back on if they are miscued. "
"Attention is the way that the brain can focus on a particular stimulus while ignoring another, allowing someone to be selective about the information a person chooses to notice at a particular time. If someone is paying attention to something because it is difficult or new and they are intentionally focusing on it, it is called controlled attention, or endogenous attention because it is based on something the person is aware of consciously and they are doing it deliberately. However, attention is not perfect and sometimes change blindness occurs. Change blindness is when we are paying controlled attention to something so deeply that we fail to notice the changing of other things around us, such as the color of a room or that the person speaking to us is someone different from the moment before. Posner studied attention and found that people notice things they are looking for more quickly than those they are not. Posner's cueing paradigm showed that people are much quicker at noticing things they are primed to notice and that it takes time to switch attention to new things. "
"carrell 2. Bottleneck theory means that there is only so much information that can be processed by the brain at a time. When information is put in to be processed, additional information must wait until the first information has been processed before it can be thought about. It is like the brain is a funnel: much can be poured in, but it just swirls around until it has all had sufficient time to drain through the smallest part, where the brain processes it before the information can be used or acted upon. "
"Cognitive psychology began when psychologists began to talk about the workings of the mind in the same way as the workings of a computer, a machine that accomplishes specific tasks using specific parts. It was not long after that comparison was made before they began to consider artificial intelligence. Scientists wondered if it was possible to make a computer that could function like a human mind enough to convince someone that it actually was a human mind. Through that discussion, the problem of mind-brain was discovered. Are they one or are they separate? The brain does many things, but the mind-brain connection seeks to understand if the brain and the mind are the same thing or if the brain performs all tasks and we only imagine that the mind is something different. Artificial intelligence is being used to attempt to answer this question. If the brain functions as a machine, then it should be possible to create a computer that could behave enough like a human brain to trick a human into believing that the machine itself was human. In order to attempt to study this connection using artificial intelligence, psychologists did experiments, tests to see if a person could be caused to act or think differently by something done to the brain, or conversely, if the person's thoughts or actions could influence the way that the brain worked. "
"There are different theories why people notice certain things instead of others. Top down processing is when people notice things based on context or what they know, like seeing the arrows on the road signs before the cows in the field or the trash beside the road. Bottom up processing is controlled by sensory information, like a person hearing someone yell their name or seeing smoke rising from the hood of their car. This processing happens incredibly quickly, which can make it difficult to know which one is being used. One of the ways to test that is through word superiority, which is when people notice and remember letters quicker and more easily when they are in patterns of known words than when they are alone in a string of symbols or placed in unpronounceable nonsense words. This means that it is likely that top down and bottom up processing are used together. In support of this idea that the processing is happening at the same time, feature matching theory is based on the idea that the brain recognizes the features and shapes of letters instead of having to have an individual model for each letter in each form. This allows the brain to quickly recognize the sensations it is seeing and connect them together to create something it knows to look for, turning meaningless lines and squiggles into comprehensible words. "
"carrell 4. Cognitive psychology began because there were too many things behaviorism was unable to explain, like the development of language. It was also a result of computers and ideas about the brain functioning like a computer. It began to be researched to explain the things that could not be explained by behaviorism as well as to discover if it was possible to understand the brain well enough to create artificial intelligence. "
"carrell 7. The worst lobe to break would be the temporal lobe. It is the one that controls the auditory cortex, speech comprehension, facial recognition, and parts of memory. I think it would be the worst because to break it would probably mean someone had been through a terrible accident and they would not be able to remember what had happened to them, understand if anyone tried to explain, or recognize the faces of the people they love. It sounds like it would be terrifying and lonely, and I would not want that for anyone. "
"carrell 8. The sidewalk art illusions, when viewed from a certain direction, break the perceptual process that perceives depth cues. We actually perceive large holes in the concrete that are not there or giant globes sitting on top of the sidewalk. Our brains use certain visual cues to estimate depth and when those are presented in sidewalk chalk, we perceive depth that does not exist. "
"Causal brain research is particularly interesting for me. While we are able to gather more total data and make some solid guesses from correlational research, I like the more concrete results from causal brain research. Correlation does not equal causation, and many people prefer to have concrete causes so causal brain research is crucial in that respect. One example of this research is the neuropsychological study. By studying the psychology of people with damage in specific parts of the brain, it helps us better understand what those specific areas affect. While it is true that many people who have brain damage have it in more than one area, the cases with very localized damage are invaluable."
"Causal brain research uses empirical evidence to actually understand the direct effects of something on the functioning of the brain. This has contributed validity to the various functions and responsibilities of different parts of the brain. This type of research has relied on the idea that damage to a specific part of the brain causes that specific area to lose proper functioning. One of the main ways scientists conduct causal research on the brain includes studying people with damaged brains and figuring out how damage to specific parts has impeded their mental activities. Another method is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves using a powerful magnet to interrupt normal brain activity in certain areas and then observing the negative effects. A third and final method is similar to TMS, but it involves the use of drugs or chemicals in the brain to interrupt activity. An example of causal brain research that specifically relates to the first method—damaged brain research—is a case study done long ago on a patient named Phineas Gage. After a terrible brain injury that damaged Gage’s frontal lobe, scientists were able to discover what types of brain activities occur in that area by studying the ways in which he was functioning improperly after that accident compared to before. Because of his negative changes in personality, temperament, long-term thinking, and emotion, Gage’s case offered some of the first evidence that the frontal lobe had responsibilities related to those things."
"Change blindness is a phenomenon that occurs when we fail to recognize major changes that happen in our visual field. Many times we experience change blindness when our attention is selectively given to some central point of interest, causing us to completely ignore the rest of the scene we are actually seeing at the time. However, what exactly is attention? At any given moment, our brains are receiving information from several different kinds of stimuli in our surrounding environment that we experience all at one time. Attention is a process that involves some of this information getting enhanced while other information becomes reticent. There are two separate kinds of attention, endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous attention is voluntary and is based on things within us (knowledge, ideas, ect.). On the other hand, exogenous attention is involuntary and is due to powerful stimuli outside of our control, such as a sudden load noise. An important model for studying visual attention is the Posner cueing paradigm. In this paradigm, a target shows up in one of two locations and participants say whether or not it is present. Their ability to detect a target is better when the target is present at the cued location than when the target shows up in an uncued location. This shows how people carry out attentional shifts."
"Change blindness is when a change in stimulus is introduced and an observer doesn't notice it. Attention is when concentrating on a some descrete information whether it is subjective or objective, controlled attention is the persons ability to choose what they want to pay attention too and what they don't want to pay attention to but endogenous attention which is voluntarily. Posner's cueing paradigm is a neuropsychological test that is used to asses attention. All these together all has to to with attention a change in attention or the observer noticing a change of the sort. "
"Change Blindness: Missing changes in our environment"
"Changs blindness - occurs because we think we see, remember, and notice more than we actually do. It occurs when we do not notice differences being made in our surrounding Because our focus is elsewhere. "
"Cogitative psychology started because in 1879 a man named Wilhelm Wundt from Leipzig, Germany wanted to understand consciousness."
"Cognition has several fields within it, the first of which was cognitive psychology, which is the study of the thinking mind.  However, cognitive psychology focused exclusively on the level of information processing. Information processing is using a computer as a way to understand the human mind. Concentrating at the same level of analysis we have artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the field where researchers are attempting to program computers so that they perform cognitive tasks. Neither cognitive psychology or artificial intelligence pay much attention to ways in which information processing takes place in the brain. Cognitive psychology is tested through experiments which leads to theories in which will lead to more experiments. Experiments are the task of looking for casual relationships between different things, manipulating variables. There are three types of variables used within experiments. First, we have individual variables (IV), which are the variables that we are manipulating.Second, we have dependent variables (DV), which are the variables that are the measuring factors, what we are interesting in testing. The final variable we have is extraneous variables, which are confounding. As stated above cognitive psychology is tested through experiments, which lead to theories. One theory is the Mind-Brain theory. The Mind-Brain theory attempts to determine with the mind and brain connect with one another. There are levels within the Mind-Brain, the levels of analysis. We have the physiological level and the mental level. The critical aspect of this theory is that a distribution at one level cannot override or be replaced by another level. "
"Cognitive neuroscience is the study of where thinking comes from and/or occurs in the brain. Neurons and lobes of the brain as well as the hemispheres are studied in cognitive neuroscience, in hopes of measuring and proving where the cognitive mind exists in the brain. The study of mind-body is a good example of the studies taking place in cognitive psychology. Trying to determine how the mind works with the body or how they work separately would be essential in determining where the cognitive mind originates from, or more specifically which part of the brain.  "
"Cognitive psychology (CP) is a branch of psychology that observes the mental process and how it interacts with senses and behavior. Cognitive psychologist set out to understand the relationship between the mind-brain. The brain is the actual organ and is something that is visible, whereas the mind is something that is not visible. Many psychologist understand that the mind is consciousness, and has the ability to be separate from the brain. Psychologist are able to observe and explain mind-brain functioning via experiments which is a scientific approach to understanding things. An example of experiments within the Cognitive psychology would be the need/understanding of artificial intelligence (AI). AI is when computer software has the ability to take on human intelligence. This all fits together because CP sometimes wants to understand the mind without other factors such as feelings. Computer systems are able to make ""decisions"" based on information imputed without having ""extra variables"" "
"cognitive psychology become in the mid 1950 early 1960. Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of the mind and mental function. Why do we do what we do or like what we do. I believe that cognition started to be researched because they believed that there was more to mental activity, they decided to get more in dept with it when researched found new ways of testing predicitions, they started to say that mental activity was like a computer.  "
"Cognitive psychology began after the invention of the computer and after people were ""revolting"" against those who believe in the behavioral perspective. Psychologist began to study the inside of our thinking; whereas behaviorist believe we couldn't study that because we couldn't see it. It began at the MIT Symposium of 1957, I think."
"Cognitive psychology began as a reaction against the psychological studies of behaviorism. Psychologists that focused on behaviorism believed that searching for brain processes or things that could not be empirically measured at that time was a waste- they only wanted to study what they could observe. For example, behaviorists would measure a physical reaction to a stimuli rather than monitor someone for a less easily observed psychological reaction. Behaviorists were unable to do much research because they would only study that which could be observed and could not understand the process of perception, so cognitive psychology was born. Cognitive psychology began at the 1957 MIT symposium, but really took hold in the 1970s. The invention of computers lead to cognitive science, because computers were the best and first model we had that was similar to the human brain. Cognitive psychology is heavily pursued by the military to study the best ways to lay out computer displays and to build machines that would be operated by humans."
"Cognitive psychology began during the mid-20th century during WWII. Computers were becoming more popular and the use of artificial intelligence was introduced. Cognitive psychology was starting to be researched because researchers wanted to test which soldiers would be best under stressful and intense situations. Researchers also wanted to figure out how to best train soldiers for war."
"Cognitive psychology began in 1957 at the MIT symposium. It was a reaction to behaviorism and was tied to the development of the computer. Researchers became very interested in the computer and how it could be used to model the human brain. Cognitive psychology gave researchers a way to test their hypothesis on how the human mind worked using computer programming. They were able to use the computer as a tool to represent the internal aspects of the human mind that could predict behavior. Cognitive psychology was also used extensively in the military to improve their soldiers and to test their IQ's."
"Cognitive psychology began in 1957.  Scientists were studying human behavior and used computers to experiment various brain processes which may produce various behaviors and responses. "
"Cognitive psychology began with Wilhelm Wundt and his followers who studied introspection very heavily. Although there were issues with their approach, they founded the way for breaking down mental activity. Cognitive psychology started being researched as an answer to the problems with behaviorism, because it could not give any answers as far as language, perception, etc. Artificial intelligence was a major breakthrough in the study of cognitive psychology because people tried to use computers to imitate human behavior. However it was found that the brain is difficult to understand because a computer can not be programmed to be exactly like a human.  "
"Cognitive psychology came about during the 1950’s. Behaviorism, which focused only on the observable and assumed that mental processes could not be studied, had taken over psychology for many years. However, psychologists were dissatisfied with its inability to explain various mental processes. Chomsky highlighted behaviorism’s inefficiency with regard to language, others criticized its difficulty in explaining complex learning, etc.. As a result, the cognitive revolution unfolded and cognitive psychologists showed that mental processes can indeed be studied. In addition to the dissatisfaction with behaviorism, a need for research on human thinking and performance due to new technologies during WWII and the development of the computer giving scientists a model for how the brain worked (information processing approach) played a major role in the being of cognitive psychology."
"Cognitive psychology can be described as the investigation on the mind and our ability to think.  Cognitive science came underway in 1957 and the cognitive revolution continued throughout the early 1960s.  It began in America when the need for psychology deeper than behaviorism arose.  This revolution was tied to the development of the computer because many scientists thought the way we think could be compared to how a computer works.  Herbert Simon, Alan Newell, and Noam Chomsky were psychologist/computer scientists that played a large role in the development of comparing the way the brain works to the way the computer works.  Using a computer to describe the functions of the brain put abstract concepts in terms that individuals could understand.  Psychologists began to study cognitive functions because they wanted a way to describe human behavior that was not directly tied to the concept of behaviorism.  Cognitive psychology allowed psychologists to study behavior in a more objective manner than introspection or behaviorism previously allowed them to do.  The use of behaviorism in psychology began to have many limitations once studied and used in depth.  Cognitive psychologists wanted a deeper, more objective way to describe mental processes and functions.  "
"Cognitive psychology can be described as the science of how we think. I think this goes directly with artificial intelligence, experiments, and the idea of mind-brain. The idea of mind-brain is basically exactly what it sounds like, it looks at where our ""mind"" and ""brain"" come together. This correlates directly with how we think which is how I think it fits in with cognitive psychology. Also, cognitive psychologists use experiments to attempt to figure out how our mind works and how we think by manipulating different variables in the experiment and seeing the outcome. Artificial intelligence comes in when we attempt to make a device have human-like qualities and for it to think/respond like a human would. We create artificial intelligence devices with cognitive psychology and experiments to manipulate different variables to see how the device will respond."
"Cognitive psychology first began in Leipzig, Germany in the year 1879. Wilhelm Wundt was the head of the laboratory. Wundt started researching cognitive psychology with the goal to understand consciousness on a deeper level. Wundt's student, Edward Titchener, expanded this research in oder to include all mental activity because the research had previously been limited to sensations and feelings. It has been said that they relied too heavily on introspection, which is the process of looking within ourself to determine our thoughts and feelings. "
"Cognitive psychology first started in Leipzig, Germany in 1879 by Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt was curious about an individual’s consciousness, and compared it to the way a chemist might view and comprehend a molecule. There are two comparisons of the molecule, one being a classification of an individual’s sensations, for example feeling hot in the summer weather or cold in the winter weather, and feelings, like joy or anger. The other comparison of cognitive psychology to a chemistry is their search for guidelines that occurs when elements merge together, for example how a person’s sensations could alter their perception of an object as a whole, instead of in separate aspects that make it up. This way of looking at cognitive psychology gives it more credibility and can rely on a method of finding out new and interesting facts about the brain and how humans work, which makes this a more reliable and scientific field of study."
"Cognitive psychology focuses on how to relate computers to psychological and mental processes. Within this study, the emergence of artificial intelligence was created by Newell, otherwise know as AI. Artificial intelligence is the ability of computer systems to act and complete processes similar to those of humans. The mind and the brain are huge factors that work together in order to complete these processes. The mind is a mental concept as the brain is a physiological concept in cognitive psychology. In order to prove this and make sense of artifical intelligence and the separation of the mind and the brain, scientists use experiments. Experiments have a methodical way of validating a concept or theory. "
"Cognitive psychology focuses on the study of the thinking mind. Cognitive psychology started off with the study of consciousness by Wilhelm Wundt. He focused on internal perception of sensations and feelings and created the first modern psychology lab in 1879. This study focused on the same concept of chemists and the way they study structure of molecues. One of his students continued this study approach to all mental activities. To get the study started Wundt's major findings consisted of how mental activity can be divided down in to many basic operations, as well as the production of methods to asses activity in the brain objectively. Eventually more perspectives came about such as the functionalist of William James. Instead of mental activity like Wundt did, he focused on funtions of those activities associated with the world. Another perspective of behaviorism came about from many psychologist focusing on how behavior is associated with the brain. The Cognitive approach came about in reaction to the behaviorism in 1957. This research was directly affiliated with the computer and how to relate internal mechanisms to behavior. Cognitive psychology started being researched heavily by Simon, Newell, and Chomsky. "
"Cognitive psychology generally represents the scientific study of the intangible and invisible mental activity in a brain. More specifically, cognitive psychology studies the various levels of processing that occur in the brain, how information is encoded, stored, and retrieved, and the effects of mental processing that can be seen in behaviors, attitudes, actions, and perceptions. Because computers have been helpful in the “cognitive revolution,” it’s no surprise that engineers and scientists have used them to mimic the brain. Artificial intelligence (AI) is simply an attempt to simulate human cognition in inanimate, computational machines. This technology builds off the idea that intelligent machines can be designed to mimic the data storing and retrieval processes of a brain. While scientists have been successful in designing technology that is able to gain knowledge and understand basic communication, it is still not perfect. AI still has a long way to go before truly being on par with all the processes in human brains. When discussing the mind-brain, or the connection between the physical brain and the mind of a person that represents more than just physiological processes, scientists have had much disagreement over the years. Some argue that the mind and brain can be separated into two different concepts, like the ideas of hardware and software of a computer. The brain is hardware that absorbs sensory information and moves that information around by using electrochemical processes. The mind represents software, which processes the input information to give meaning to it and allow for a full understanding. Other scientists also use the computer analogy to say that the brain encodes, stores, transforms, and retrieves information just like a computational machine. These concepts are all very abstract, which is why it took so long for cognitive psychology to be accepted as a valid area of study. Empirical research, done through experimentation, has added validity to the theories and concepts connected to cognitive psychology and bolstered its reputation since the days of early psychology. Experimentation done by psychologists and other scientists has added up over the decades, and the experiments that show agreement with one another represent converging evidence. When scientists who are studying cognitive psychology get similar results, or the same results, the corroborating data increase confidence in the accuracy of various theories. Today, methods of studying cognition include different types of technology, which has moved cognitive psychology from a strictly abstract field of study to one in which we can view how the brain is working in real time with the help of machines like EEGs and MRIs."
"Cognitive psychology got its start in Germany. Wilhelm Wundt ran a lab in Leipzig, Germany that would be known as the first lab of its kind. Wundt is credited as the individual who really got this look into cognitive science started. Although Wundt wanted to know how to look at things we can't physically observe, the idea faced a lot of criticism. This is when behaviorism started to get so much attention because it was a form of study that had observable measurements.  Long story short, behaviorism found its flaw in that some questions simply couldn't be answered by behaviorism. I think this is why cognitive psychology finally got put in the spotlight. Cognitive research could ask and answer questions in a different way than other forms of study. So, cognitive psychology served as a reaction to behaviorism. As stated in our lecture, one huge example was when it came to understanding the human during WWII. It was realized that they really needed to know how a person thinks and processes information. Another huge step was the development of the computer, which made the study of cognition much more possible. "
"Cognitive psychology in its earliest form began in nineteenth century Germany in a laboratory operated by Wilhelm Wundt. He focused his research on consciousness and helped create the idea of introspection, or analyzing one’s own mental activity and thoughts. The concept of introspection ended up being something that damaged the reputation of Wundt and his colleagues because other scientists had trouble understanding how invisible processes could be studied in an objective way. Behaviorism represented the scientific countermovement that followed Wundt; it proposed that science should focus more on observable and directly measurable events and actions. Hull and Skinner represent the behaviorists of this era who rejected the theories on introspection and unobservable mental activity. However, behaviorism’s inability to describe several unexplainable human behaviors (e.g., language, decision-making) led to another countermovement: modern cognitive psychology. With the rise in computers and the information processing approach to psychology in the 1950’s-60’s, people could finally talk about how the brain functions in a more understandable way. Cognitive psychology has been better at scientifically explaining all different aspects of human nature and behavior because it is focused more on the mental processes behind the scenes of observable actions. Even though it initially required more abstract thinking, cognitive psychology has been able to develop objective ways of studying thinking and gathering data."
"Cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology that studies internal processes of the brain. The brain is responsible for processes such as perception, thinking, learning and memory. Artificial intelligence is a computer-orientated developmental process which aims to have technology perform human like tasks such as voice recognition, translation, and even visual perception.  Studying the mind-brain is  the very first step towards developing sophisticated artificial intelligence. Both cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence progress through research and experimentation. Hypothesizing, predicting, and testing ideas is the only way to create globally supported theories in both of these fields."
"Cognitive psychology is a field of science that is interested in the mind and how mental functions work. Since it is a science, experiments are utilized to consider the causality of relationships between two variables by manipulating an independent variable and observing the effects on the dependent variable. After several experiments are conducted and show certain data, theories could be put into place to explain how the mind works, one theory being the mind and brain theory. The mind and brain theory is an idea that the mind and the brain work together but utilize two separate levels of analysis, mental thinking and physiological actions of neurons, which complement each other.  One way of testing this at this is through artificial intelligence, which is a computer system which has been modified to simulate the human mind. For instance, a model could simulate the average human mind, but at some point, an anomaly in the data will occur. If researchers recreate the variables and situations in which the anomaly occurred, and the human mind functions in the same way as the artificial intelligence model, they have then learned something about the human mind from the behavior of a computer program."
"Cognitive psychology is a field that is dedicated to understanding how the mind works and what the thought processes are behind our behaviors. It is made possible by experiments, which are scientific ways of testing hypotheses or theories. We seek to use experiments to further our understandings in this field and find out new information. Our brains have specific ways of processing the information that is taken in by our sensory systems, but our interpretations of that information is what sets cognitive psychology apart from other fields. Understanding of this information has led to the creation of, and researching of, artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is using a computer in an attempt to recreate the way our brains use, store, and regurgitate information, essentially mimicking the human mind. I use the word “mind” in that sentence because there is a delineation between the brain and the mind. The brain is a combination of body tissues that functions in such a way that allows us to take in sensory information, store it, and maybe regurgitate it at a later time. Neurons in the brain are the driving force for this and send information where it needs to go. Our mind is our conscious awareness of that information and our ability to recall or use what we have taken in so that we can interact with our environment in meaningful ways. This is the essence of the mind-brain. The mind is separate from the brain in that the mind is the result of biological processes of the brain. We are able to have a mind, a person, a consciousness, an awareness, because of the functioning of the brain. Without a functioning brain, the mind is not present."
"Cognitive psychology is a science that is the study of the mind and its mental tasks. There is a difference discussed in cognitive psychology between the mind and the brain. When using the brain to discuss mental processes, it more closely is describing the biology and not the psychology of a thinking mind. Experiments in cognitive psychology are used to develop a better understand of the mind and its processes. These experiments are often in the development of artificial intelligence as a way to better understand the mind by the comparison to the computer. Artificial intelligence is an attempt to simulate the mental process of the brain to help better understand how it works."
"Cognitive psychology is defined as the psychological study of activity in the brain. In other words, topics may include memory, perception, language, and other topics related to the brain and its mental processes. In the field of cognitive psychology, we are interested in studying the mental processes of our brain and trying to determine how artificial intelligence compares to a human being. This can be done through the use of an experiment. Experiments are when we set out to see if a hypothesis is true. The experiment will often contain many participants who voluntarily agree to take part in a research study. After the experiment is over, we analyze the data that we have collected and record our results. There have been many experiments completed in the field that seek to determine if the use of artificial intelligence is more effective than tasks completed by humans. Artificial intelligence is the act of programming computers to complete cognitive tasks that are typically performed by humans. The ultimate goal is that the computer will be able to complete the tasks just as well, or even more efficiently than a human could. This is supposed to make our lives easier and will cause less errors. However, one thing that technology lacks is mental thoughts and feelings. Mind-brain is the interaction between our brain and our mental thoughts, feelings, and processes. Technology may have a programmed ""brain"", but we have a mind that is much more complex because it involves thoughts, feelings, and emotions."
"Cognitive psychology is really focused on how the mind works in regard to perception, language, attention and memory. It focuses on mental processes such as how people think and the way people feel and behave. The cognitive approach to psychological processes has been closely related to the way computers function because they serve as models for researchers to explain how the human brain works. This is what brings about the importance of what is called artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the development of really complex computer systems for the purpose of simulating the cognitive functions of humans. In regard to human thinking, there is the question of the mind-brain connection. Using the computer as a model of human mental processes, this question essentially asks if the brain is the hardware and the mind is the software, or if the mind and brain are the same thing and both perform as hardware and software. There are two ways that this is analyzed. On one level we have physiological components of the brain such as neurons firing and stimuli input. However, we also have mental processes such as thinking that occurs in the brain. In order to understand the relationships and connections between the mind and brain (as well as many other processes involved in the field) cognitive scientists use experiments. The purpose of experiments is to find a causal relationship between things by manipulating variables (when variables cannot be manipulated due to ethical concerns, correlational studies are performed)."
"Cognitive psychology is the area of science that studies the brain’s interaction with the mind. In doing this, cognitive psychologists concern themselves with what parts of the brain correspond to specific perceptions and actions. What area produces speech? How exactly do we see things? Which part tells our arms and legs to move? This is what the cognitive psychologist studies. In this field, the mind-brain relationship is analogous to the software-hardware relationship in computers. The neurons (hardware) fire in specific ways to produce specific thoughts and actions (software). To that extent, artificial intelligence has been closely linked to cognitive psychology because of the similarities between a computer and a brain. If we can develop a sophisticated enough computer with good enough software, we should be able to develop a suitably human artificial intelligence. Cognitive psychology is a science, and thus participates in the scientific method of formulating a hypothesis, testing that hypothesis and making changes to the hypothesis as a result of data. These tests are done through experiments where psychologists manipulate an independent variable and see what changes happen with a dependent variable.  "
"Cognitive psychology is the area of study that focuses on the thinking mind and how it works. Initially, cognitive psychology was based off of the mind-brain connection. The question that arose between this connection is are they separate (or) is the person separated from the brain? In order to answer this question, one must analyze this mind-brain connection from two different levels: physiological and mental processes. Physiological processes deals with the brain at the neural level whereas the mental processes dals with the act of thinking. Moreover, being able to study the mind-brain connection in cognitive psychology can be attributed to using artificial intelligence (AI) through the information processing approach. AI is a good representation of how the brain and mind work; software in computers represents certain processes within the brain such as being able to interpret information or language whereas the hardware within computers represents certain areas of the brains such as the occipital and frontal lobes. AI can also be used to run experiments without data being skewed by eliminating social desirability bias and other such errors. The reason for running an experiment is to find a causal relationship between two variables. In an experiment, there is a factor that is manipulated (called the independent variable) to help differentiate a change, which can be evaluated by comparing the control group and experimental group. The factor that is being measured is called the dependent variable. If a causal relationship were to be present after multiple experiments produced the same results, those results from the experiments become theory. That theory is then tested again through more experiments in order provide accurate information that can possibly be used in our everyday life."
"Cognitive psychology is the area of study that focuses on the working mind, and thinking processes. The main focus of cognitive psychology started out as the mind- brain relationship. This is questioning if there are two parts to the human, like the person and then the brain, or are they the same. This can be studied at the level of neurons, and brain firing, or the act of cognition. A lot of cognitive psychology is done by creating artificial intelligence systems. This is a system in which we create a computer model that we believe will react how people normally would when given a task or asked a question. If the AI gives back an unexpected answer, then it gives the researchers another aspect to test, and then try to alter the computer to conform to the expected way. The AIs allow researchers to run experiments. This is a way to test if what they are thinking is actually happening. The goal of the experiment is to link the cause and affect relationship between two things. This task is done by changing the different variables that could be a factor in the study, this is the independent variable, and measuring the variable being studied, the dependent variable. If the experiments are proves a causal relationship, after so many repeated experiments, then it becomes a theory. If it shows something that was unexpected, then that usually leads to more testing. "
"Cognitive psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of the mental processes involved in attention, language, reasoning, perception, memory, problem solving, and decision making.  Cognitive psychology was not labeled as a term until 1967.  It was widely believed that the mind could not be studied.  It was also believed that the mind could not be measured.  Dutch physiologist Franciscus Donders began the first cognitive psychology experiment where he studied reaction time.  In his experiment he did not measure the mental response directly, but inferred how long it took from the reaction times.  His experiment showed that mental responses can not be directly measured.  His experiment showed that mental responses must be inferred by observing behavior.  More experiments were conducted to expand upon what we know about cognitive psychology such as:  Hermann Ebbinghaus studied the nature of memory and forgetting.  Another scientist who conducted a cognitive psychology experiment was Wilhelm Wundt, he studied structuralism and analytic introspection.  Many tried to reproduce Wundt's experiments to reveal hidden mental processes.  Another scientist who conducted a cognitive psychology experiment was William James, who studied the principles of psychology.  Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of all mental processes and the mind. "
"Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of the mind. This science often uses artificial intelligence, computers, to help us understand how the human brain works. They do this by performing experiments such as asking the computer questions and seeing how it responses. Scientists can take this response and compare it to data using real humans to see if it is an accurate representation of how humans work. This leads into why we study the brain, the Mind-Brain theory. This is a theory that discusses if the mind, such as someones soul or who they truly are is separate from the brain which is just the physical working matter."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of how humans think, and how we use the thinking mind. Mind-brain is a debate over whether the mind(person) is using the brain, or if the brain is using the mind, or whether they are really separate beings. The invention of the computer was able to help cognitive psychologists gain a better understanding of the brain with terms they would understand. Artificial intelligence is the use of computers and simulating the human mind. Experiments are ways to look for causal relationships between two or more things. We use experiments to study many aspects of psychology and the human brain. We are able to test theories and ideas that stem up in psychology with experiments, and computers are there to assist to either simulate the mind or process results of a study, for example any experiments concerning the mind-brain."
"Cognitive Psychology is the study of how the brain functions; it is a science.  To be able to test and find out how the brain functions we use experiments.  Experiments are searching for causal relationships between things, and in the case of cognitive psychology, experiments are looking for casual relationships between what makes the brain perform certain activities. The study of cognitive psychology came about when computers were made.  Computers and technology have advanced and today we have a concept known as artificial intelligence.  Artificial intelligence (AI) is programming a computer to do cognitive activities.  This programming is a processing system that tries to do activities the same way to the way that humans perform certain activities.  Although these programming systems are close to perfection, there is one thing that hold AI back from performing tasks exactly like humans do, and that is the human mind-brain connection. There are levels of analysis in the mind brain connection.  There are neurons (physiological) first level, and there is the mental (thinking) level. AI cannot perform tasks like this that require levels of analysis because the programming system needs to have exact instructions.  "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of how the brain processes sensory input to form perceptions of our environment. The study was inspired by the creation of artificial intelligence, which is a digital execution of human behaviors, and the processing components. The researchers used this early computer as a model to explain brain function. To test the theories of this new field of science, researchers conducted experiments by manipulating various inputs and studied the resulting outcomes. The work eventually led to different concepts of cognition. One concept is the mind-brain theory. The mind-brain theory is the idea that the mind and brain are separate. The study seeks to explore how the mind and brain interact to produce reality and how they connect to accomplish this."
"Cognitive Psychology is the study of how the brain thinks. Mind-Brain is a theory that explores whether or not the mind and the brain are separated or not. Artificial intelligence has to do with technology. An example is the usage of computers to simulate the mind. Artificial Intelligence is information processing though artificial testing. Experiments are ways to test theories and ideas. Experiments lead to theories, which leads to more experiments. All of these ideas are related. Cognitive psychology is directly related to artificial intelligence and computers. Both study how something thinks. There is an artificial intelligence chart that shows if something is more like AI or Humans. It starts with the experimental question ""do people do that?"" which leads to ""get data,"" and then ""can a computer do it?"", and finally you end with things people don't do. The first two relate to humans cognition and the second two relate to computers. The Mind-Brain Theory started as just an experimental question: ""Are the mind and brain really separate?"" The brain requires information processing. This includes storage, manipulation, and the transformation of information. All of these things are functions that also make up a computer."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of how the brain works; how we process information and make decisions. Prior to the invention of the computer, studying the brain wasn't of much interest because it was assumed to be too complex. Computers are a form of artificial intelligence in that it mimics the inner workings of our minds and breaks down decisions and actions into steps. Once the computer was invented, cognitive psychology shot off. Experiments over the brain began and included manipulated variables, measured variables, and controlled variables. For example, brain blood flow being measured after people experience different stimuli, such as a loud noise. Experiments were able to help us understand which parts of the brain controlled what actions or operations. Cognitive psychology and experiments lead to the idea of the mind-brain connection, which is physical workings of the brain combined with information processing or ""thinking"". The mind and brain are not two different entities but rather are intertwined and dependent of one another."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of how the mind thinks and interprets stimuli. To test the mind, experiments are used, which are done to determine why one variable causes another variable to do something. One reason experiments are used is to determine the connection between the brain, which is physical, and the mind. The mind-brain approach is how the mind and brain come together to solve problems. Scientists have studied the mind and have been able to come up with artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a computer that is able to answer questions like a human mind."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of how the mind thinks, which means scientists attempt to determine how feelings or information is represented in the brain. Scientists use experiments, which are scientific processes that attempt to show causal relationships by manipulating variables, to study how information flows in the brain. When cognitive psychology first became popular, scientists were inspired by the invention of the computer, which was the first and best model of the human brain. Scientists use computers to aid them in studying the brain, since much of the experimentation on the brain cannot be done directly and has to be correlational. Computers can also be used to produce artificial intelligence, which is an attempt to mimic the human mind. Artificial intelligence creators seek to create a machine that performs like a person does, and if it does not match up with a person's actions, we continue experimenting with new ideas. Once artificial intelligence is created, some people might wonder if the machine's brain, or processing unit, produces a mind (or soul), or if the soul is a separate thing. This is called the mind-brain theory. Essentially, the mind-brain theory questions whether the mind (or soul) is produced by processes performed by the brain, or if it is a separate thing that exists whether or not hte brain is functioning."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of human language processing , problem solving skills, as well as information processing and memory and perception. Cognition is the way we think and why. Artificial intelligence is the creation of a computer or program that would be able to simulate all of these factors included in cognitive psychology. A successful A.I. would be able to have the same thought and mental processing as a human and would able to pass certain expirements that are involved in something like a turing test. This type of test is used to determine if an A.I. is successful by testing if a hidden A.I. can pass as a human when it's robot qualities are hidden from another human. Expirements like this as well as other,s which include a scientific plan to test a hypothesis or to prove a fact can be used to test the successfulness of artificial intelligence. Testing A.I.'s can lead to questions about the human brain and mind and if they are separate or the same. This can point to the fact that humans may only be able to make A.I. somewhat human-like because we can only create a brain-like program but not an actual mind. This leads to the question of, are the mind and the brain separate things, many debate that they are completely separate in such cases like a coma state in which the brain is working but the ""mind"" is absent,  but many also argue that they are one and the same but just involve different parts of the brain for bodily functions and independent thought. "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of information processing. We are able to study this by using experiments to help us better understand how the information process works. Experiments have several components to lead us to better information. It has variables such as independted and depended factors that researcher manlipate to test to their hypothesis. Experiments lead us to better understand the topic we are studying and compare to other research. When we are looking closer at this area, we are studying the mind-brain. The mind-brain is a storage and transformation of information. There are neurons and help with this process. Thought experiments we have been lead to Artitifical intelligence this is when human are trying to program computers to do a deeper cognitive thought out task. "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as attention, memory, and perception. Directly connected to the development of the computer, cognition is able to compare the mind to a computing machine. With this belief, examined by Simon and Newell, computers were able to be used to simulate the mind through artificial intelligence. The mind-brain connection, which questions whether or not the two are actually separate, is analyzed through two levels: physiological and mental. Through performing experiments, these hypotheses could be tested using an information processing approach."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes. To be able to find out about the mental processes researchers experiment to learn about them. Experiments are ran to find out more about the processes and how they work in the brain. There are some experiments that are successful and some that fail but through this process of trial and error more experiments are produced to discover more processes of the brain and understanding their job. Artificial intelligence is a way that we are able to stimulate and model a human mind in the way they react in situations that humans go through. This is where experiments and artifact intelligences are related, experiments are conducted on the intelligences to see if they truly mimic a human beings reaction or the act of one and from here the experimenter can tell if the machine is good at doing that or not. If not they will do more work on it and then experiment again to test it. It is hard to get a machine to be perfect at being a human because there is one part that they will be missing, the mind-brain. The mind-brain is argued and seen differently. The brain is the part that has to do with psychological part of the neurons in the brain and the neurons them selves firing. The mind is the part that interprets neurons acticity in the brain and is the thinking part. This is what artificial intelligence has not been successful at yet."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of mind and mental functioning and many other things that go in the brain such as memory, attention, decision making, etc. A lot of this is todays world is continuously changing and of the reasons for that is artificial intelligences. An example of an artificial intelligence would be Siri that comes with all iPhones. This is changing cognitive psychology because it requires the human mind brain and the cognitive part of how we take in information to work less and makes it easier and faster to process information. There are constantly experiments being done to see if artifical intelligences can do more to change the world than just make our day to day lives easier. "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of the human mind and how it functions. The functions that it includes are learning, memory, attention, perception, language, decision making and more. We have discussed most of these topics already this summer, but the first topic we discussed was artificial intelligence.  Artificial intelligence is defined as the development of a computer software program that is built to function like a human brain. An example of a program with artificial intelligence is Siri. When you speak to Siri, she is able to hear your commands, and process the information, and reply back to you, (almost) just like a human would. Computer programmers from all over the world join these competitions to see whose program is the closest to a human brain. To test their artificial intelligence, the programmers software is put through multiple experiments. An experiment in this case, is to see how tell something does or does not work. And for our first class experiment, we got to participate in a similar experiment that is used to test these programs. We were given 2 sample conversations, one was answers that was given by a human and one whose answers were given by an artificial intelligence program. We were then asked if we could pick out which responses were from a human and which were from a computer. Luckily, me and many of my other classmates were able to identify which was a human response and which was a computers response, and we had our mind-brain for that. Mind-Brain is a theory that says that our mind and brain work together to make decisions like this one. We can use our past experiences and current information to make conversation- Something a computer still can't completely do. "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of the human mind in regards to mental processing such as perception, learning, and memory.  Experiments in the realm of cognitive psychology are scientific procedures conducted to learn/determine something in regards to human mental processing.  Mind-brain theory is the theory that mental processing/events can be grouped into types and then linked to types of events that occur in the brain.  Artificial intelligence is the theory of computer systems being able to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence and thinking in order to perform.  The theories and results of experiments in cognitive psychology along with the ability to relate event grouping to brain functions are used to help design and develop artificial intelligence computer systems."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of the mind-brain and our mental processes. The mind-brain is the fact that our minds and brains are two things that work together but are completely different. Psychologists perform experiments in order to better find how the mind-brain work together and to advance the field in cognitive psychology. These experiments and research lead to things such as artificial intelligence which is when people try to make technology act and have as close to human properties as possible. By understanding how the mind-brain works and with the different experiments done in cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence is coming close to acting in ways that are close to that of a human. "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind, and one of the beginning pieces of this field was the formation of theories of cognition. One of those beginning theories was the mind-brain, which basically asks the question of if they are really separate, and if so, how? This also begs the question, can we really think about thinking, or introspection, which threw cognitive psychology into scientific doubt when behaviorism took charge of the psychological world. We were first able to talk about these concepts in a commonly understood vernacular because of artificial intelligence such as computers being created. We could see the processes used to make them function, and apply that concept to our own minds (or brains?).  We use experiments, which consist of manipulated variables (Independent Variables) and measured variables (Dependent Variables) to find a causal relationship between two things. Using this method of controls, IV's, and DV's, we are able to find out how our brain processes information and where. "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind, and was not heavily researched until the development of the computer in 1957. Researchers began to compare the computer as a model for how mental activity took place. Scientists like Herbert Simon or Alan Newell provided examples as to how progress could be achieved by relating the brain to a computer. Thus artificial intelligence emerged, which is the use of computers to simulate the human minds. The point of artificial intelligence was to see if the computer could act like a human. With cognitive psychology growing, many experiments were done which eventually lead to many theories. Experiments looked for causal relationships between things by manipulating variables or correlation studies. A popular theory developed by experimentation is known as the mind-brain connection theory. The biggest question it created was if the mind and brain were connected or do they act separately? Some believe that they are separate, a person creates their own thoughts and interpretations, while the brain is responsible for making sure the bodies physiological processes are working. "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind. Artificial intelligence is simulating the mind through computers. The mind-brain connection strives to show that the mind and the brain are not separate by analyzing physiological processes and mental processes. All of these things are connected by experiments. Psychology first started as a philosophy, people were curious about the mind. Wundt conducted experiments and was the leader of the first modern psych lab. This bred Thitchener, James, and so many others to learn to conduct experiments to find out how the brain worked. As more and more of these experiments were conducted more was learned about the brain, and computers were used to simulate the mind, artificial intelligence, and even more was learned about the brain through this process and the mind-brain theory was born."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind. In the 50's and 60's, computers were studied to compare their processes with that of the human brain. While we have actual thinking processes, computers use artificial intelligence to operate like a brain, but there are still gaps that the computers lack. One theory in cognitive psychology is the mind-brain connection. This includes two levels, the psychological and the mental. The psychological system of the brain includes the neurons taking information in and transforming it into messages our brain can understand. That message is then decoded by our mental system and can be called thinking. This theory suggests that the brain is a separate system than our thinking minds. This theory, among others can be tested by experiments, which are tests that look for causal relationships by manipulating variables. For the brain, it's hard to find causal relationships without breaking ethics, so correlations are used instead. These don't show a cause, but do show a trending relationship. Parts of an experiment include the independent variable which is the one being manipulated and the dependent variable that is measured. Experiments can help to support or deny theories in cognitive psychology."
"Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind. It has been studied because it's a science, we have a need to know about this ""brain,"" and if we can figure out how to not have to think so hard, that's a plus! Cognitive psychology started as philosophy with Descartes and Locke. It wasn't until Wilhelm Wundt started researching introspection in Germany in 1879 that really started the cognitive drive. Wundt's two main contributions included developing methods to tests mental activity and breaking down cognition into smaller pieces. After him, Titchener worked on sensations and perceptions, William James in America took after Wundt as a functionalist and described that our brain works with evolution as deemed useful. Skinner and Watson studied cognition under behaviorism. The actual birth of cognitive psychology started as a reaction to behaviorism. In 1957, at the MIT Symposium, psychologists worked with the military to make psychological tests for their recruits. Around this time, cognitive psychology had also started being compared to computers and how they work like a brain using artificial intelligence."
"Cognitive Psychology is the study of the thinking mind. Psychology started as philosophy with Descartes and Locke. Wilheim Wundt is largely considered the founder of psychology as he had the first lab that studied the human brain and how it thinks. He used associations studies, so how someone associates a picture with a word and to say what they're thinking or introspection. A student of Wundt, Titchner, is considered the second founder of psychology. He tackled the thought ""how can we study things that we cannot see (how one thinks)."" Titchner relied too much on introspection. Next, William James studied how specific mental activity functions in the world. From his studies came the term ""functionalist."" A functionalist is someone that believes that certain practices are better suited for some than others. The next stage in psychology was Behavioral psychology. This was led by Hull, Skinner, and Watson. Hull believed that all internal events can by analyzed from someone's behavior. Skinner took Hulls studies farther to reject all internal events. There were several limitations to behaviorism. Behaviorists couldn't explain some human behaviors such as language and also couldn't provide explanations for perceptions. As a result, cognition psychology came to be. A lot of the birth of cognitive psychology has to do with Military research and specifically the MIT Symposium in 1957. The military did a lot of cognitive testing.  Cognitive psychology started to be studied out of human curiosity. It is a science. Humans do not like to think very much and we prefer newer things. We like things to be simple and we like easy answers. Another reason people study this is out of competition from other researchers and how to apply it to daily life. "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of understanding how we perceive and process information through our mind- brain connection. Mind- brain is broken down as brain the physical science side where is the mind more of our thought processes and how we perceive certain stimuli. Experiments are the process of testing a hypothesis to understand how something works. All these processes are necessary to develop artificial intelligence which is a computer system that can act and think like a human."
"cognitive psychology is the study of what is happening in our brain. They study the mental processes like attention, memory, perception and more. To understand this truly we must first differenate and understand the difference between the mind and the brain. The brain being a tangible object that is computer like processes. The mind being intangible, it contains thoughts and conciousness. To understand this we run expierments testing each part of the brain and what it is used for. Once we are fully able to grasp the concept about the mind and the brain and understanding fully cognitive psychology we will be able to create artifical intellegence. Artificial intellegence is computer generated life that is able to think freely. They will be able to think logically but also think using things like emotions and perceptions. To do this though, we must first understand ourselves and how we function to ever be able to code something that can think freely. "
"Cognitive psychology is to believed to have its roots with the establishment of the first modern psychology laboratory in 1879, in Leipzig, Germany. The person that is responsible for this research is Wilhelm Wudnt. Cognitive psychology originally started as a philosophy and the father was Wundt. It was a response to the behaviorism train of thought, and out of it brought the development of the computer, 1956 MIT Symposium, and Miller's Magic #.ge "
"Cognitive psychology really began to catch wind in the late 1950's. Studying mental activity began much more acceptable as it began to replace to ideas of behaviorism which had just described stimulus-response-consequences relations. The rapid growth of this new method of research is best known as the cognitive revolution. Developments in computer science was a key factor in this revolution. Cognitive psychologists began to compare the inner workings of the computer and its functions the human brain. An example of this would be that a computer has external hardware and internal software. Behaviorism was also a becoming a problem for world war two. Military psychologists demanded new answers in order on techniques such as military placement and training. This also became a huge product of what is now called cognitive psychology."
"Cognitive Psychology somewhat started with Wundt’s research of how to study the things we can’t see which was introspection, then with behaviorism how to study the out-put of the brain through observable things we can see and was ultimately birthed from behaviorism. Cognition merges behaviorism. Cognitive Psychology started in 1957 at an MIT symposium as a reaction to behaviorism and millers majic number. Cognitive Psychology started being researched because researchers wanted to study the thinking mind and also to study the brain in terms of computer terminology."
"Cognitive psychology started as a response to another field in psychology known as behaviorism.  Early psychologists like Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener began studying mental activity like sensations and feeling and introspection.  Introspection is the process of peering inside ourselves to observe our own mental activity.  As time went on, behaviorists such as Clark Hall and B.F. Skinner denied all theories on mental activities.  B.F. Skinner, for example, rejected all talk of internal events completely.  As time went on, however, cognitive science was created at an MIT symposium in 1957.  The area of cognitive psychology was studied by use of a computer, to further understand just how our inner minds work."
"Cognitive psychology started as philosophy but the first official start of psychology was in Germany in 1879. The reason why cognitive psychology started being researched was because they wanted to research things the two founding fathers couldn't see and obviously you cant see thoughts."
"Cognitive psychology started at the 1957 MIT symposium. Cognitive psychology began being researched as a response due to the failures of behaviorism. In addition, Cognitive psychology research gained momentum during this period due to technological advances and the development of the computer. Scientists believed that the computer could be used to understand mental activity (cognition) in the brain.    "
"Cognitive psychology started at the MIT symposium in 1952, as a direct reaction to behaviorism. Simon, Newell, and Chomsky compared the mind to a computing machine, thus connecting the Cognitive Revolution to the development of the computer."
"Cognitive psychology started because scientists and psychologists were curious. Curiosity leads to new findings and studies. Psychologists from the very beginning like Wilhelm Wundt found new prospective ways of perceiving onsomeones mental activity. Edward Titchener furthered the approach of cognitive psychology. Together, they found ways to break down and objectify mental activity assessments. "
"Cognitive psychology started being researched in Germany by Wundt. He looked into introspection. Tichener followed and did his research more on sensations. The researchers of the time were focusing on behaviorism at the time. There were certain things that behaviorism didn't cover such as perception. "
"Cognitive psychology started in 1879 in Leipzip, Germany. The head of the first laboratory was Wilhelm Wundt, who was interested in conciousness. One of Wundt's students, Edward Titchener, expanded on his research to include all mental activity, instead of only sensations and feelings. Together, they relied too heavily on introspection, which is looking at oneself to evaluate their mental activity. The school was successful at breaking down mental activity and developed methods for looking at mental activity. "
"Cognitive psychology started in 1957 at a MIT symposium. Cognitive psychology was a reaction to behaviorism and was tied to the development of the computer. Researchers believed that the computer was a model of how the human mind worked. It was used as a tool to represent the internal aspects of the brain, so they could potentially predict behavior. Researchers were able to test their theories using computers as a model of the human brain, to see if they could act like humans did."
"Cognitive psychology started in Germany and it started being researched after the invention of the computer when they realized that the brain runs and works in ways similar to that of a computer. They were then able to utilize the computer as a tool to research and learn more about how the brain works. "
"Cognitive psychology started in Germany by Wundt and Titchener. Cognitive psychology started being researched because of the development of the computer, the 1956 MIT Symposium, Miller's Magic Number, and the reaction to behaviorism. The development of the computer in the 1950s-60s was a way for human mental activity to be researched. Computers allowed researchers the study and research the internal processes that produced behavior. The 1956 MIT Symposium proposed that there was much more to experimental psychology and language, and cognitive processes that needed to be discovered. The shift from the contents of consciousness; introspection and functionalist perspective, to behaviorism. Behaviorism focused on the observable: stimuli and responses. Behaviorism rejected all internal events, or the “unobservable”. As limitations of behaviorism became common, the cognitive revolution occurred. This limitation and rejection of behaviorism occurred because of the development of the computer, which signaled the cognitive revolution."
"Cognitive psychology started in Germany where Wilhelm Wundt opened his first lab that studied introspection. This is why his nickname is the Father of Cognitive Science. Cognitive psychology researched escalated when Behaviorism failed in certain aspects such as not being able to describe this such as perception without saying introspection was a real concept."
"Cognitive psychology started in Germany with Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener. They focused very heavily on introspection or assessing your own mental activity, which is why they were challenged in later years by behaviorism as it was too subjective. In response to behaviorism came cognitive psychology through the likes of Herbert Simon and Noam Chomsky. Cognitive psychology was tied to the development of the computer. They modeled the language in which they described the basis of behavior in technological terms, such as hard drives. It helped eliminate the problem of introspection by helping cognitive science become more objective. "
"Cognitive psychology started in Germany with William Wund testing reaction times of his subjects, and also researching introspection. Introspection received a lot of criticism though, because behaviorists believed that we could not think about thinking, and that we could only measure psychology with identifiable actions. Cognition started being studied more when the computer came about because it gave us verbage we could compare our minds processing to. In addition, the 1956 MIT Symposium, and Miller's magic number of I believe it was 7 plus or minus 3 (things we could remember at once) provoked cognitive psychology to become more prevalent. "
"Cognitive psychology started in Leipzig, Germany with the Father of Cognitive Science, Wilhelm Wundt, but moved to the Americas with William James who looked at the purpose behind mental activities rather than being able to study things we do not have the ability to see to measure.  Following the trend of behaviorism, cognition arrived in order to explain things that behaviorism could not.  These include language and perception.  Cognition arrived with the MIT symposium in 1957 and was further invested in by the military.  Additionally, Miller’s Magic Number became a landmark for cognition becoming popular and started a new turning point.  The arrival of the computer aiding in the advancement of cognitive psychology by lending terms that could be used to make sense of the thinking process.        "
"Cognitive psychology started in Leipzig, Germany, where the first psychology laboratory was established in 1879 by Wilhelm Wundt. Cognitive psychology started being researched, in part, due to behavioral psychology. Behavioral psychology was heavily scrutinized because it could not explain internal activity. Behaviorists failed to understand the deeper, unseen mechanisms and insights that could not be determined based on simply observing behavior. While behaviorism was useful to an extent, and many behavioral studies work hand-in-hand with cognitive psychology today, psychologists needed a way to research the mind and mental activity that lead to the behaviors that had previously been studied by behaviorists. The cognitive revolution was really when cognitive psychology was heavily researched and developed, due to the computer. Before, cognitive psychologists relied too heavily on introspection, but with advanced technology, there was a new way to approach cognition. The computer, while not advanced to the level of really unveiling cognitive processes or brain activity, was, in a sense, personified and used to compare to the human mind. In order for the computer to work, the directly observable parts were of no use, instead it was the underlying parts and programs that resulted in functioning. Likewise, in order to really understand topics like perception or language, simply observing behavior would not suffice, rather going inside to the mind would provide a deeper understanding."
"Cognitive psychology started in Leipzig, Germany. Wilhelm Wundt was the one that was focused on the consciousness and the head of the laboratory. He is today the father of cognitive psychology. They wanted to know the answer to many questions about mental activity so this is why the first established first modern psychology laboratory was in 1879 so they could discover the answers to all these questions about mind. "
"Cognitive psychology started in response to behavioral psychology in order to combat the shortcomings and flaws in behaviorism. Behaviorism gives reasoning to a lot of actions, but it does a poor job explaining things like language. Cognitive psychology aims to explain all of these things. Cognitive psychology really took off along with the development of computers as computers provided a good analogy for how different parts of the brain did processing. The military especially put a lot of focus into this field and the development of things like aptitude and IQ tests. "
"Cognitive psychology started in the 1950's after scientist decided that behaviorism was too limited. The mark that really started the beginning of cognitive psychology began with George Miller. Miller founded what he called, ""Miller's Magic Number,"" which was the idea that most adults could only remember up to 7 things on a list, plus or minus 2. Millers findings provides evidence of short term memory, which lead scientist to conduct other experiments using this information. There was then again, another big break through with the invention of the BINAC computer. The BINAC was able to preform logical operations (something no other machine had done before this). This gave scientist the idea that our brains work much like a computer, creating the Information Processing Approach. "
"Cognitive psychology started in the late 1950's and it is called the cognitive revolution because when the information came about it was so dramatic. During that time period, psychologists were focused on behaviorism but when information about cognitive psychology came to the surface, psychologists denied behaviorism and developed the computer. This area of psychology became more popular throughout the years and became dominant by 1970's by Piaget and Tolman. When the computer was invented, that is when cognitive psychology really took off. It allowed psychologists to study human cognition and compare the complexities between the two ""machines.""  Cognitive psychology started to be further researched because psychologists wanted a better understanding of how it worked, what was involved, and ""know"" everything about it. Since it took over behaviorism, they wanted to know new ways to perceive things, understand concepts and processes, new ways to experiment with the subject and how they could compare it to other processes and other ways that humans ""know"" things. They discovered the idea of information processing and that became the model of how human thoughts, how they process information, and how the whole concept worked. "
"Cognitive psychology started in the late 1950s and early 1960s and was directly tied to the development of the computer. Cognition was a reaction to behaviorism which caused the birth of Cognitive Science in 1957. Herbert A. Simon, Noam Chromsky, and Alan Newell all worked together to create a central role during this revolution by comparing the mind to a computing machine."
"Cognitive psychology started Wilhelm Wundt. He established that the things we see such as shapes, colors, and textures can be explained through perception. Then Wilhelm's student Titchener came along and furthered Wilhelm's theory. He suggested that these things we perceive not only that but he wanted to take it to the next level by exploring sensation and what goes ion in our brain mentally. Wundt and Titchener used introspection that helped further their research and to better understand perception and sensation. Introspection is understanding how people see things. Cognitive psychology begin researching how people processed things, and activities by using introspection."
"Cognitive psychology started with the ancient Greeks and Plato. It started being researched because it was suggested that the brain where mental processes came from."
"Cognitive psychology started with wanting to understand how people work. But to be able to understand them we needed to know how they body, mind worked before understanding beyond that. Cognitive psychology started being researched due to scientist wanting to understand behaviorisms. This revolution of cognitive psychology started around 1960s this was when computers started to become a big deal. Researchers thought it would give them a better introspected on the mind if they compared mind vs. computer. This helped researchers to think about internal events and not just the observable stimuli that they had been looking at. "
"Cognitive psychology started with William James, an American psychologist who wanted to challenge the behaviorist way of studying psychology ( the behavior movement was a challenge of the introspection view). This movement started in 1957 and was based off a functionalist perspective which had to do with the idea that the way we think as well as certain attitudes and practices have come along because they are ""better suited for the environment we are in"". This believe is strongly tied to to view of Charles Darwin and the idea of the survival of the fittest. This study of cognition translated into standardized testing used in the military which is still used today.  Cognitive psychology started as a way to better understand how people think which also included how people communicated as well as their memory, and information processing. "
"Cognitive psychology started with Wundt in Germany. He led the first modern psychology lab and defined introspection. Cognitive psychology started being researched because people were curious about how the mind worked and wanted to learn more about it."
"Cognitive psychology studies mental functions such as conceptual learning and memory. Researchers do studies and use experiments to learn more about how the mind works and its mental processes. They like to look at behaviors brought on by certain stimuli that can help explain what went on in the brain to get them to respond that way. They knew that the brain was a functioning organ in the body that relies on neurons to function but wanted to know how it goes about thinking on it's own. We can picture things before we do them all on our own, using many senses at once. Researchers like to think of the brain as a thinking machine, like a computer. In order to experiment more on the differences between our brain and a machine, researchers may use artificial intelligences. Artificial intelligence technology tries to imitate the mind of a person in for example a robot or other machine. They try to match up what humans do to their study subject and see how well they can make it match up. Unlike robots, humans have free will and other decision making processes that are still being researched. Studying how people think can help us learn more about the brain and people's behaviors and mental processing."
"Cognitive psychology was a reaction (revolt) to behaviorism. It began at a 1956 MIT symposium with the new development of the computer. Also included in the development of cognitive psychology was Miller's Magic Number (7 +/- 2). Cognitive psychology was initially researched because it was used for the military. The military is the largest buyer of cognitive sciences. "
"Cognitive psychology was a response to behaviorism, which was a response to introspection: how can a scientist observe the unobservable, such as behavior. Since scientists became interested in studying behavior, this has been their biggest problem. How does one record data in order to make a hypothesis and test it when dealing with abstracts like feelings and reactions? Cognitive psychology strove to make this possible by, using computers as their models, they described how mental activity took place. By using a computer as a model, scientists were able to gather what they needed to do experiments regarding cognitive psychology. They were able to test predictions and test them objectively, formulating hypotheses and testing them to find causal relationships. One of the theories that was tested was the ""mind-brain"" connection. With the new terminology that was provided from computers, such as ""hardware"" and ""software"", it was easier to define this connection: is the mind the ""software"" and the brain the ""hardware?"" It helped scientists see if the two were actually separate. Also from this connection of mental activity and computers rose artificial intelligence or computers that simulate the human mind.  We see examples of AI all around us these days, from SIRI or IRIS to ""Ok Google"". Technology that can predict how humans might think or react can only grow to something that will either help us exponentially or destroy us. "
"Cognitive psychology was born during the cognitive revolution which started in the late 1950's, in response to what is called behaviorism. Behaviorism focused on purely immediate stimuli, responses, and consequences rather than focusing on the hidden mental activity making us do what we do. Gaining knowledge of the limitations of behaviorism , other researchers began to adopt other approaches to measure mental activity. If it weren't for rapid technological advances, such as the computer, we would not have the knowledge of mental activity that we do today. "
"Cognitive psychology was established in a modern laboratory in 1879, in Leipzig, Germany by Wilhelm Wundt. Wudnt student Edward Titchener wanted to extend his approach to cover not only sensations and feelings but all mental activities. "
"Cognitive Psychology was started as a philosophy in Leipzig, Germany by a man named Wilhelm Wundt. Cognitive Psychology started being researched because of general curiosity. We wanted to explain things we see in everyday life to include oneself. Cognitive Psychology was a reaction to behaviorism."
"Cognitive psychology was started as philosophy and was directed more towards sensations and feelings. Wilhelm Wundt was a German psychologist that lived from 1832-1920 is known for introducing the first psychology lab of cognitive psychology in 1879. Cognitive science really didn't get explored further until Edward Tichener, a student of Wundt's, believed that cognitive psychology was not only feelings and sensations but was deeper than that and wanted to really study what we can not see, all mental activities. Cognitive psychology itself started being researched because people were curious on how the brain worked and with more and more advances in technology and understanding we are finally able to research the cognitive side of psychology. "
"Cognitive psychology, or the study of the thinking mind, is a complicated subject that people have been trying to understand through various ways. People want to understand the mind-brain connection whereas everyone has the same underlying characteristics of the brain, however everybody has different thoughts, emotions, etc. Different varieties of research have been done. The beginning of cognitive psychology saw a lot of trying to figure out the workings of the human brain through the use of artificial intelligence. This is because people were trying to program computers to act like humans, the questions of the mind lie in the fact that computers are still distinguishable from humans. Psychologists have thus used other experiments to figure out cognitive psychology. An experiment involvles the manipulation of variables to find a causal relationship."
"Cognitive started as a philosophy. A German man named Wilhelm Wundt started the first lab for cognitive psychology. They started research because they wanted to know what your are thinking which is called introspection. They thought the greater you could understand that people were thinking the better you would be at understanding them as people."
"Computers that can do tasks like a human are refereed to as AI or Artificial Intelligence. For example, the automated phone system responds to your answers from the cued questions they give you for help numbers. This is something that has had experiments done to see how well AI would work in the real world. The experiments would see if there might be a correlation or causal relationship in the field of cognitive psychology, which is the study of thinking and this is where the mind-brain connection comes into play. Your mind is for thinking, while your brain helps to process and store this information, so can artificial intelligence help the world if it out performs humans someday? This would need more experiments done to get more information for that question."
"Correlational brain research is a way of assessing the way the human brain functions.  This is done by associating the areas of the brain that are being activated when information processing occurs.  This allows for patterns to be created.  One example of correlational brain research is a MRI or fMRI.  This scan measures the amount of blood that enters an area during use and excels at demonstrating the space where this occurs.  The ratings for time are not favorable and it causes a moderate amount of discomfort.  On the spectrum of cost it ranks on the more expensive side. "
"Correlational brain research studies what happens in the brain when we ask people to do something. In this type of research, the results are measured based on the reaction and nothing is manipulated. There are four dimensions of evaluation for correlational neural methods. First, spatial relation is how accurately the area that produces the signal is localized. Second, temporal resolution is how accurately changes in brain activity are tracked over time. Third, invasiveness is the measure of how much hurt it will cost the participant or the degree to which foreign substances require introduction into the brain. Fourth, cost is evaluated for both the equipment and it use in each participant’s test.  An example of this type of research is an electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG measures the electrical impulses that are coming from the brain. It is used to see what action potentials are firing in order to determine what the brain is doing. A stimulated brain will produce short, quick waves, whereas a relaxed brain will produce slightly more spaced out waves. "
"Correlational neural research examines how the human brain works.  This type of research looks for correlations that can possibly expose patterns between what parts of the brain controls what activities.  One important thing to remember is that correlation does not mean causation, some of the brain parts that are detected during an activity are just along for the ride.  An example of a technique used for correlational neural research is the electroencephalography (EEG). An EEG is performed by placing electrodes on someone's forehead and the electrodes measure and record the fluctuations of electrical activity over the testing time.  These ""brain waves"" will show how much or little activity is present during different sets of frequencies, known as bands.  These tests could be used for a lot of everyday activities, like sleep patterns.  EEGs are common because they are inexpensive, very accurate and are not very invasive. "
"Damage to one or several lobes can cause blindness, deafness, aphasia, loss of motor functioning, memory loss or can inhibit the ability to form new memories. None of that is ideal but a possibly worst case scenario is that someone or several people may have to take care of you and our society can make accommodations for some handicaps. However, if someone damages their frontal lobe just ever so slightly then the ability to make sound decisions may become impaired. Say you get into a car accident and you hit your head on the windshield and you have to go to emergency room. It is a possible due to damage to the frontal lobe that you went from being a straight A student at Missouri State University to working third shift at Wal-Mart stocking shelves. While on break you enjoy going into the public bathrooms and drawing pornographic images or racist statements on the stall panels. After your shift you go back to your studio apartment and smoke copious of marijuana and during that process you amuse yourself at the expense of your cat or dog, that you are not authorized to own, by blowing pot smoke into his or her face."
"Dementia is a type of research. Dementia is a disease that normal occurs in the elderly population. This is a disease that is on the rise. Normal the elderly may not recognize family or friends. They forget and don't want to eat. They can loose a lot of control of their ADLs.( activity of daily living). This disease usually ends up taking their life from all the side effects of not eat and other onset of medical issue that arise. The type of research is the study of aging and growth of brains to see how this disease develop. A long with trying to produce a medication that will stop the process. "
"Depth cues is one of the illusions we discussed in class. Because our eyes view something based on its size and how its location, etc., how we perceive these illusions is misleading. The slides showed pictures of drawings that made things look real, when really they weren't. "
"During the Mexican wave at sports games, people are not physically moving down the stadium. Instead, there is a reproduction of the wave that moves continuously among the people in the stadium. This is representative of an action potential. Once an action potential has been initiated at the start of an axon, there is nothing psychically moving but rather the charge that is being reproduced is moving along the axon. These action potentials that resemble the Mexican wave are the electrical signals that our neurons use to communicate. The neurotransmitters are what carry the messages that these neurons communicate. An axon releases a chemical neurotransmitter which then binds to a particular receptor site that fits whatever type of neurotransmitter it is (i.e. dopamine, serotonin). Dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter that is released into the frontal lobes. The frontal lobes are what allow us to form thoughts and focus attention. However, Broca’s area is also located in the frontal lobes making this area responsible for speech production as well. When the neurotransmitter dopamine is released into the broca’s area, it can impact speech and the thought patterns involved with it."
"eastwood Attention is a way our brain processes information by enhancing some information and blocking out other information.  This process allows us to process specific information, the information being enhanced, better and on a deeper level than if we processed everything at the same level.  We think that we can focus and take in all the information about our surroundings, but sometimes the information we dismiss and do not focus on can change without us even noticing. This is called change blindness.  Change blindness is missing a change in our environment or something in our visual field.  Change blindness occurs because we are focusing more on one aspect of the information more than another aspect of information in our visual field.  Most change blindness is caused by controlled attention.  We choose to focus our attention on things that are interesting to us, fit our goals, or are beneficial to us.  When we set a goal to find a red pair of pants at the mall we might walk through an entire store focusing our endogenous attention on finding a pair of red pants that we miss the big shoe sale going on.  If there were a giant flashing sign right above my red pants, I would find them quickly because the sign would catch my attention, and when I looked at the sign I would see the pants below.  This is similar to Posner's cueing paradigm.  Controlled attention is what we control and what we choose to focus on at a given time.  In the experiment we completed in class, I personally focused my attention on the conversation between the women rather than what was on the table and what the women were doing with their hands so I did not catch many of the tests for change blindness.  Controlled attention requires a lot of effort so we are more inclined to let changes in our environment go unnoticed.  We focus our attention according to our goals.  An example of this is in the experiment done by Simons when people were asking for directions.  The people being asked for directions did not notice the change of the person asking possibly because their goal was to navigate the person rather than get to know them.  "

This is called change blindness.  Change blindness is missing a change in our environment or something in our visual field.  Change blindness occurs because we are focusing more on one aspect of the information more than another aspect of information in our visual field.  Most change blindness is caused by controlled attention.  We choose to focus our attention on things that are interesting to us, fit our goals, or are beneficial to us.  When we set a goal to find a red pair of pants at the mall we might walk through an entire store focusing our endogenous attention on finding a pair of red pants that we miss the big shoe sale going on.  If there were a giant flashing sign right above my red pants, I would find them quickly because the sign would catch my attention, and when I looked at the sign I would see the pants below.  This is similar to Posner's cueing paradigm.  Controlled attention is what we control and what we choose to focus on at a given time.  In the experiment we completed in class, I personally focused my attention on the conversation between the women rather than what was on the table and what the women were doing with their hands so I did not catch many of the tests for change blindness.  Controlled attention requires a lot of effort so we are more inclined to let changes in our environment go unnoticed.  We focus our attention according to our goals.  An example of this is in the experiment done by Simons when people were asking for directions.  The people being asked for directions did not notice the change of the person asking possibly because their goal was to navigate the person rather than get to know them.  "
"eastwood Bottom up processing is driven by sensory information and data.  We interpret the smaller pieces of input and develop a bigger picture in response to the stimuli.   Most recognition theories are bottom up processing.  There are four grouping principles of bottom up processing for explaining how we interpret the building blocks for perception.  They are proximity, continuity, closure, and similarity.  Proximity is when we group things together because they are close to each other.  Continuity explains why we see an ìXî as two straight lines rather than two checkmarks or v's.  When we see something headed in one direction, we expect it to continue moving in that direction and group things in that way.  Closure is the idea that things that are closed will be seen as grouped in our mind.   This is true for common objects as well.  When we see a shape that is open, we will use our expectations and top down processing to see the shape as if it were closed to fit our expectations. Similarity is when we group things together that look like each other.   Top down processing is driven by context.  We take the information that we know from previous experiences and create expectations for our daily interactions with the world.  Through these expectations we can change the way we perceive things.   Word superiority explains how we can read words that have been scrambled in the middle, might be spelled incorrectly, or maybe a person has terrible handwriting, because of our expectation of what it is supposed to say.  We like to see real words so we can almost create them with our expectations.  We can have a different perception of the same sensation because of our expectations.  In instances with bad hand-writing, the sensation of a mark on a paper might not actually be interpreted as a letter if it stands alone, but when it is in with other letters, we can perceive that mark as a specific letter because of word superiority.  Word superiority is a top down information process.  We can only perceive letters because we created them. We can also use the feature matching theory to determine what letter is missing.  If it is taller than the others letters and has a cross, it is either a ìtî or ìfî ìJî, or maybe if it is tilted slightly, an ìxî.   Feature matching theory is the idea that we look for simple but characteristic features of something so that we can categorize information in our brain without having to work as hard.  We also do not have to store everything we have ever seen in our brain to remember it the next time we see it.  By using feature matching, we know that a furry critter that walks on four legs is an animal rather than a fish.  In order to be feature matching, all features have to be noticed at the same time and in different parts of the brain.  "
"eastwood Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind.  In order to study the thinking mind, experiments have been conducted.  Experiments are extremely important in understanding the way the brain does and does not work.  Through both failed and successful experiments, new ideas and new experiments have been discovered.  Experiments allow us to test the information we have established in a ìrealî setting, like establishing artificial intelligence.   Artificial Intelligence is attempting to simulate and model the mind and create reactions from a computer that are similar to how a human would react in a given situation.   As machines are created to act like humans, experiments determine if the machine successfully reacted like a human, or if the machine needs to have more work done.  The difference between artificial intelligence and an actual human being is that the machine will lack mind-brain connections that humans have.  Different people see the mind-brain idea differently.  The brain is the actual neurons firing and the physiological happenings in the brain.  The mind is the thinking part of the mind-brain concept, and the interpretation of the neural activity happening in the brain.  There is no purpose for the firing neurons if the mind isn't there to interpret what the firing means.  The mind also has to have something to process, so if there isn't any neural activity then the mind doesn't have anything to decode.  Artificial Intelligence has not successfully established this mind-brain connection.  "
"eastwood Cognitive psychology started in Germany.  Willhelm Wundt is considered the father of cognitive psychology. Cognitive psychology was studied because psychologists are scientists and scientists are curious about learning how things work, doing collaborative studies, and making a lot of money through application and discovering new things.  It was a new field to attempt to study something that we cannot see and attempting to measure thoughts and introspection. Behaviorism was pushing back with things that can be measured and counted, so the field of cognition was not explored very much yet.  Chomsky started some research on language and it was a big boost for cognition because it could not be explained by behaviorism, so cognitive research became popular in psychology.  "
"eastwood Embodied cognition is the concept that we use the same parts of our brain to imagine something as if we were to actually physically perform the act.  In order to be able to imagine something, we have to have information stored about what happens when we actually do the action.  Similar to motor cognition, we draw on stored info and past experiences to form the imagination.  When I played basketball, my coach would tell us to lay on our backs with a ball and imagine shooting it.  I never understood why, and I'm not sure he understood how it actually worked either, but it was to activate the same parts of the brain.  It didn't train the muscles, but it did make me use my motor cortex to imagine shooting the ball."
"eastwood Experiment: Chimeric Faces Demo- In this experiment we looked at two faces at a time and chose which face we thought looked happiest.  For each set of faces, one face had a ìhappierî right side and the other face had a ìhappierî left side.  The goal of this experiment was to look at the laterality of people's brains.  Groups: right dominant and left dominant  Independent Variable: The happy side of the face, right or left Dependent Variable: How happy we rated the faces"
"eastwood One type of brain research is using behavioral methods.  This type of research uses observable and measurable behavior It looks at output from a person and creates data to help us try to understand the brain.  Some problems with behavioral research are that you are working with people and some tests can be too easy and some can be too difficult.  These are called ceiling and floor effects, respectively.  These are bad because the data is all the same and there is nothing to analyze and learn from.  Also, because this requires working with people there are problems with people are worried about what they think is expected of them and what is being demanded of them so the circumstances are not normal.  An example of this research is timing participants reaction times to a specific stimuli like a sound. "
"eastwood The Bottleneck Theory is the idea that some mental operations have to be done one at a time. Our brain cannot handle all the information at one time so it has to be funneled according to importance.  The reason this leads to failure while performing is because we can only do one thing well at a time, so the information we chose not to process as well will suffer.  If our brain tries to do two things at once then neither tasks will be performed well. A real life and scary example of this is texting while driving. "
"eastwood The Mexican Wave is an analogy to understand the way neurons communicate with each other and the path they take to relay information.  It is an elctro-chemical process.  The dendrites receive a message and if it is ìexcitingî enough, then the neurotransmitters will activate the neuron and the message will be relayed down the axon. At the end of the axon there are terminal buttons.  Between the terminal buttons and the next cell there is a tiny space called a synapse.  The terminal buttons will release the neurotransmitters into the synapse to communicate with the next cell.  Neurotransmitters are chemicals released into the synapse to communicate, transfer information, and carry messages into the next cell like serotonin and dopamine.  Once the neurotransmitters are released from the terminal buttons, they will bind to the receptors on the new cell that they fit.  This process is chemical.  The frontal lobe is located on the most anterior aspect of the brain on the forehead.  The posterior aspect of the frontal lobe contains the primary motor cortex, which uses the Mexican Wave to produce muscles movement.  The frontal lobe is where the initial spark is created for muscles movements.  When I decide to pick up my leg, the muscle neurons are activated by the interneurons, which were activated by the neurons in the primary motor cortex. They use the Mexican Wave to communicate from the brain out to the leg to tell it to move.  The frontal lobe also contains Broca's area.  Broca's Area is the part of the brain responsible for creating a verbal response to what we have heard.  Broca's Area also uses neurotransmitters and the Mexican Wave to relay messages to the mouth for speech.  "
"eastwood The worst lobe to break would be the temporal lobe.  I think the temporal lobe mostly because of the face recognition and memory aspect.  Not being able to recognize your loved ones would be terrible.  Not being able to recognize them is one thing, but if someone tells you who they are and you still can't remember then that would be extremely frustrating.  Our whole view on life is made up of our past experiences.  We store those experiences as memories, so I'm not really sure who I would actually be without my memories.  Speech comprehension from Wernicke's is also very important.  If that is broken, then Broca's area can't do its job either, so you would get a double whammy.  The least important aspect of this lobe is hearing.  There are plenty of people who lead happy, independent lives that are deaf.  "
"     The brain is made up of millions of units called neurons which are responsible for electrochemical reactions that allow for communication throughout the brain and body. Neurons contain dendrites which receive information carried by neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by the neurons and are often times positive ions such as sodium and potassium. Once the threshold is met there is enough action potential to send the message (electrically) along the soma to the next dendrite. This electrochemical process is referred to as the Mexican wave because a neuron waits for a signal from the neuron before it to fire just like a wave. For example, the Frontal Lobe is responsible for the motor cortex. So neurons in the frontal lobe receive a signal to move out of the way of an incoming vehicle. Once the sensory neurons that perceived the threat receives enough signal it travels to the interneurons then finally the motor neuron where eventually the Na/K pump gets activated and so on until the body has enough energy to jump out of the way. The Broca’s area functions in a very similar way. First it receives sensory information from the things we hear. Then after enough neurotransmitters are received an electrical impulse travels through Broca’s area to help us figure out what we want to say in response to the things we hear. "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because it give’s psychologist an idea of what happens in the brain. Sensation is all the sensory neural input that gets processed by the brain. Perception is making sense of all of the sensory input and giving it meaning to us. For example in vision, the different colored lights would be the sensory input but perception is what turns the lights into a picture we can understand. "
"     There are so many signals around us that if we took them all in at once our brain would become overloaded and things wouldn’t have as great of meaning. That is why attention is so important. Attention enables us to focus on the things we find most important and tune out the background noise. For example, change blindness is the phenomenon that occurs when there is a large change in the background that people don’t pick up on. This is due to the fact that their minds are attending to other sensory input or it could be due to attention blink as well. Another example of attention is when you’re trying hard to focus on a task. This type of attention is called controlled attention because you are actively trying to control what you choose to attend to. It takes high effort to do this so something like paying attention to your professor’s lecture when you can smell the papa john’s pizza outside of the PSU is a great example of how much effort controlled attention takes. Similarly, endogenous attention attends to things in a top down fashion; it relies on cues you are already aware of to try and focus on a desired object. Posner’s cueing paradigm experimented with endogenous and exogenous (cues given from the environment) and found that people were very fast when cued where to look (exogenous) and much slower when miscued because they would have to “move” their attention and control it in an unexpected manner. "
"One model of attention is the attention blink. In this theory the brain focus on the first thing then completely blacks on the next thing in its attention span. Some psychologist thinks this is because things compete with others and there is interference between the two competing objects. The mind can only focus on one thing at a time so the second set of information gets blinked."
"Cognitive psychology is a field of psychology that was born because scientists wanted a more concrete way of studying the mind and how humans think. They base their theories on studies that often times used artificial intelligence as a way of modeling how humans think. First they would create a form of intelligence and see how the model thinks. They then get research on what humans do and see if the artificial and real intelligence match up. If they don’t, then they revise the artificial intelligence until enough scientists agree that it is an accurate model of how our minds work. The scientist get this research by setting up experiments which indicate a correlation between two variables. In order to be the most accurate all confounding variables must be controlled for in order to find a causal relation instead of merely a correlation. The experiments conducted do not truly show a significant difference between the mind and brain, however some conclusions have been made that state the brain receives the neural input whereas the mind gives it meaning to us. "
"We can process things in two main ways: top down processes and bottom up processes. Top down processes relies on information you already know. So if you’re trying to find your friends at the park and you know she has blonde hair, you attend to people with blonde hair in order to find her. An example of this would be word superiority which states that people are better at recognizing letter presented within a word familiar to them than if the letter was presented on its own. Feature matching theory similarly states that we match features in let’s say letters based on already stored knowledge.  Bottom down processing doesn’t relied on any preconceived cognition. It is stimulus driven and relies on information that the subject is taking in. "
"eche 4.  Cognitive psychology started as a revolt to introspection and behaviorism. Introspection was a way of         looking at psychology by observing the traits within but it wasn’t very valid. Behaviorism also studied the behaviors of humans in order to draw conclusion about us but again there were a lot of confounding variables. So cognitive psychology started in the 1950’s and it was a way to test theories against models in order to form a theories about how humans think. "
"Embodied cognition is the idea that cognition is influenced by the experience that we have. This is evident because the brain parts used to complete a task are the same parts that are used when thinking about doing this task. An example of this would be that the same brain parts are used when a violinist imagines playing a song and when actually playing the song. In theory, expert violinists are better at playing the violin because there brain can imagine all of the motions involved in playing the instrument."
"eche 7. I think the frontal lobe would be the worst to break. It is responsible for much of your personality, speech, and movement. I feel without it you wouldn’t truly be able to be yourself. Since it has Broca’s area it is responsible for how you respond to things. I think communication is a big part of what makes me happy. Also it contains the motor cortex which is responsible for facilitating movement. I know that I always want to remain independent and without it it would be very hard to get around and communicate what I’m feeling. "
"eche 9. I use a cognitive map to get around to my classes each day. I am a little more familiar with my surroundings so I use a very contextual visual map. I live right off of Madison Street so first I cross the yellow parking lot. Then I walk through the grass until I hit strong. After that I turn left and continue walking to whichever building my class is in."
"elam A cognitive map that I still tend to use in my every day life is a route map. I just moved to Springfield a couple of months ago so a lot of place are still new to me. Although I have gotten better at getting around I still have to tell myself “Okay, first this turn, then this one, then that one, etc.” A route map is route specific. It is useful for getting someone from point A to point B. When I first moved here my point A was my apartment and my point B was school."
"elam Attention is the process that enhances some information and inhibits other information. In other words, it’s what allows us to focus on one thing while not being as aware of the other things going on around us. For example, in class, attention is what allows us to focus on what the teacher is saying instead of being constantly aware of what the people around us are doing. Attention is related to change blindness in that sometimes we miss things that happen in our visual field while we are paying attention to something else. An experiment that was done on this was when people were asked to give directions to a place and the person asking for directions was switched with another person when the person giving directions was turned around. The point was to see if the person giving directions would notice that the other person had changed, and they didn’t. Change blindness is a way that attention sometimes tends to fail us, however, endogenous attention is a way in which attention benefits us. Endogenous attention is top down processing and is a focus on attention that comes from within you. So, for example, my husband’s favorite football team is the Carolina Panthers, so anytime I go anywhere that has football stuff I look for Panther stuff. That is endogenous, or controlled, attention. An experimental example of endogenous attention is Posner’s Cueing Paradigm. Posner’s Cueing Paradigm is an experiment that was done in which a person was given a t-shaped symbol to look at and another one popped up. If the second symbol popped up where they were told it was supposed to then the individual looked there very quickly, this automatic attention because it happens very fast. The second time, the second symbol popped up in a different place than they were told and this caused the persons attention to shift to the position in which the second symbol appeared. This is endogenous attention."
"elam Attentional blink is a short period of time in which information is not registered. It’s like when you blink and you don’t see something as a result of that. What this model of attention explains is that a person will often times miss the second object, or word, whatever may be being used, if it is placed closely with another word. For example, if someone is shown a series of objects and words they will miss a second target if it is presented with 200 to 500 ms of the first object."
"elam Cognitive psychology is the study of the mind and how it works. It studies people’s perception, emotions, long-term memory, encoding, working memory, attention, executive processes, decision making, motor cognition, and language. Cognitive psychology became more popular as a result of the development of the computer. This era was known as the Cognitive Revolution. The computer was seen as a way to better understand the workings of the brain. The development of the Binary Automatic Computer helped the cognitive revolution to blossom. With this, researchers created new ways to test predictions from computer models which, in turn, helped to understand the order of how things happened inn the brain. The development of the computer led to the development of artificial intelligence, the branch of computer science that aims to develop computer systems that are able to think and act like humans. The Turing Test Experiment we did in class is a way to test a computer’s ability to think and act exactly like a human would. In order for the computer to pass the Turing Test a human has to be unable to tell that they are actually talking to a computer.  A lot of research has been done in order to be able to create a computer that will pass this test, there is even a competition in which there is a reward for creating a computer that is able to do this. Along with the development of the computer, various theories have been made in an attempt to illustrate how the brain works. The Mind-brain theory is one of those. The mind-brain theory says that there are different levels of analysis. The example that the book uses is that of the computer, which makes sense since the brain is often compared to a computer. On one level the computer can be described in a way that observes how the electricty changes, the magnetic fields, and how the computer heats up and cools down. On a different level, the computer can be described in terms of what it is doing. For example, is it receiving or  sending information. On this level, one relies on information processing, which is the storage, manipulation, and transformation of information. In other words, what is going on in the brain that is allowing you to do something. An important thing to note about the levels of the mind-brain theory is that they are not interchangeable, one cannot be described in terms of another."
"elam Cognitive psychology started in Leipzig, Germany in 1879 with the establishment of the first modern psychology laboratory. The head of the laboratory was Wilhem Wundt. Cognitive psychology started being researched because, like many other fields of science, scientists wanted answers as to how the brain works and the only way to do this was by starting to research and experiment on it."
"elam Embodied cognition is the idea that whenever you are imagining doing something, for example you imagine yourself writing your name, the same brain regions that are involved when you actually do the action are involved when you are imagining yourself doing it."
"elam The Chimeric Faces experiment that was done in this section of lectures was one that was used to determine the differences between the right and left hemispheres of the brain and to see which half of a person’s brain is doing the processing. It was also used to determine how lateralized people are. The groups were right handed and left handed individuals. The independent variable was the pictures that were shown to each individual of split faces with one side smiling and the other side having a neutral expression. Each image had two pictures on it:  one on the bottom and one on the top. The dependent variable was whether the individual thought that the bottom or the top individual looked happier."
"elam The difference between sensation and perception is studied for two main reasons. One being that there is too much information and the other being that there is too little information. What this means is that we might have a lot of sensations but we only end up with one perception or we might have one sensation with many different perceptions. The example that was used in class is a picture of a what could be seen as just blobs or blobs that make up the image of a dog. Of course, what the image actually is depends on the person. One person might say that the picture is just blobs while another insists that there is a dog. Each person has a different way of percieving sensations."
"elam The Mexican Wave is a way to think about and understand how a message goes from dendrites down the axon and to the axon terminals. It is a pneumonic device for action potential, which is the electrical process for the communication of neurons. Neurotransmitters tell what the message is. For example, if the message is “oh, that’s hot, don’t touch that” the neurotransmitters are the ones responsible for passing along that message. Neurotransmitters are especially important in regards to speech. The area of the brain that is in charge of speech production is Broca’s area. This area of the brain is responsible for hearing information and thinking about how we would like to respond to what it is we are hearing. Broca’s area is located in the frontal lobe, the lobe of the brain that is located at the front. The frontal lobe also houses the primary motor cortex, the prefontal cortex, and Broca’s. This lobe of the brain is responsible for abstract thinking, attention, and speech production."
"elam Word superiority is the phenomenon that people are better able to recognize letters within words than those that stand alone, letters that surround a given letter may suggest a word and therefore influence the perception of the central letters.  Top down processing is controlled by context information and bottom up processing is driven by sensory information. So, for example, let’s say you’re learning how to cook on the stove for the first time and you put your hand on the stove because you don’t know that it gets hot so you burn yourself and pull your hand back really fast. That would be bottom up processing because the sensation of being burned caused you to pull your hand back. The next time you go to cook you know not to touch the stove because it gets hot, that would be top down processing. Top down processing is related to word superiority in that when a person is presented with a word, for example the word nurse, and then asked to identify the second letter, U, they are able to do so because they have previous knowledge of the word “nurse”. Feature matching theory can be seen in top down processing because feature matching theory is the theory that certain features in objects signal a match. "
"Embodied Cognition are brain regions that are activated when imagining things and is activated in the same way as if you were actually doing that activity. An example of this is singing to yourself or having a song stuck in your head. You are imagining this song and not actually singing it out loud. However, Broca's is still activated when you are singing to yourself, just as if you were actually singing. This has to do with imagery and perceptions. The brain perceives it happening, so that area of the brain is activated. Another example of embodied cognition is the Expertise at Baseball experiment. In this experiment players are asked to mentally judge how well they are hitting balls. These players are not receiving any physical feedback. They are actually not performing well, but they think they are doing well because they are imagining themselves doing well. They couldn't judge well because they were not receiving the physical feedback. "
"Embodied cognition can be a confusing concept of cognitive psychology research and can be defined as the idea or belief that the body has a special purpose and influences our cognitive mind. Another way of putting that would be that our mind is not only connected to our body but our body is connected and influences our mind. An example of embodied cognition would be that if you were to put on something such as a heavy backpack and are walking home from school, your mind is going to believe that the distance up a hill is even longer than it actually is. "
"Embodied cognition can be described as using our entire body to shape our cognition.  This includes not only our mind as you would think when you hear cognitive, but it also includes physical parts of our body.  Cognition includes higher mental processes, but this theory states that cognition also includes interactions our bodies have with the environment.  "
"Embodied cognition could be thought of like muscle memory or great experience.  With embodied cognition, many parts of your brain are experienced in a specific action or thought, therefore when actually in process, the brain does not have to think as hard for the results due to participation in the same process by many parts of the brain.  An example given in our notes for embodied cognition is in baseball.  A player is skilled in the sport and uses multiple parts of their brain, due to experience and training, to process through various actions.  An example of personal experience is the use of American Sign Language.  Through experience, many neurons in my brain have been fired (are active) for the skill.  This make the motions of communicating the language more of an automatic response.  Much like all people speaking their native language.  Language does not use much brain processing because of the experience and parts of the brain involved in the action.  Embodied cognition can be thought of as second nature response. "
"Embodied cognition deals with the regions in the brain that imagine the same things just as actually doing them. A relatable example of this concept is baseball. An outfielder deals with a lot of space and a great deal of timing skills. When a ball is hit to outfield one must figure out how to catch the ball and get there at the right time and place. They must anticipate where it will land and this is done through perception as the brain sends signals from previous representations experienced to know and predict where the ball is going. Embodied cognition does not rely on just the brain. "
"Embodied cognition describes the brain regions involved when you imagine things you are actually doing. Say, for example, you are whistling. There are areas of your brain that are activated just by imagining the actual words to the song that you aren't really saying. The fact that you probably know the words, or at least the tune or melody, can be activated just by the act of whistling the tune. "
"Embodied cognition is a a type of topic research in social cognitive psychology, such as decision making, social interactions, the argument here is that embodied cognition is influenced by motor systems for example how does a base ball player know when at the rite time should he catch the ball or know where the ball is flying to to catch the ball. "
"Embodied cognition is a concept that describes our ability to perform some action or procedure mentally, causing the same areas of the brain to activate that would if we were actually performing the action. One example of this is if I were to imagine the steps I have to take to lock the door to my vehicle, my brain would act as if I were actually doing it even though it is only imagination."
"Embodied cognition is a form of knowledge outside of our visual field and brain then implying what we see. An example of embodied cognition could be when I see someone jumping rope, I can then picture myself being able to do the same thing. It is about remembering things and then foreseeing the way they would play out if we performed that task at hand ourselves. "
"Embodied cognition is a part of imagery that shows that we use the same brain functions when imagining an action as we do when we actually do the action. An example of this would be a professional golfer imagining practicing. The same part of the brain involved in this mental tasks are the same used when doing the task. I imagine this to be the same case when rehearsing a conversation I am going to have with someone before it happens. "
"Embodied cognition is activation in parts of the brain that aid in performing actions when we are only thinking about the actions. An example of this is Broca’s area lighting up (electrically speaking) when we are singing in our heads."
"Embodied cognition is an idea that both the body and the mind having reciprocating influences on one another. In other words the body can actually help shape the way our minds function."
"Embodied cognition is an interesting concept.  This concept brings light to the fact that regions of the brain that initiate actions are the same areas of the brain that are used when imagining those actions without actually doing them.  Therefore, when you speak to someone the frontal lobe would show activity because that is the lobe that is responsible for speech production.  If you were to just mentally picture yourself talking to someone, the frontal lobe would still show activity even though you are not actually talking out loud. "
"Embodied cognition is an interesting topic in psychology. It argues that our cognition in the human brain can be molded by aspects beyond just our brain, meaning our own body and the environment. An example of this would be communication in conversations. We don't always talk about the same thing, in the same way, in the same tone. We adjust our style of communicating to fit the environmental situation we're in. Our brain is given information, and within a second, we have taken that new information and have come up with a reply fitting for the situation. Embodied cognition is the interaction between our brain, body, and the outside world almost simultaneously."
"Embodied cognition is how a person's whole body helps interpret stimuli in the environment. For example, a baby begins to learn how to interpret sights and sounds during their first few months of life. They are able to differentiate objects, such as faces, and that being held by mom and dad is soothing. Babies also begin to learn how to interpret words that the parents are using."
"Embodied cognition is how we interact with ourselves and the world around us as it impacts the way we think. Since our environment affects us so much we can think one way somewhere and think something different somewhere else. If we change what we’re doing and move a different way, we can change the way we think. Our bodies are an integral part of how we see the world. An example, of how embodied cognition works, is when you’re a child and you have all that stimulus and input coming in and your body helps organize and teach your brain how everything works around you."
"Embodied cognition is in imagining things are the same as then actually doing them. The idea behind it is that the body has a impact on the mind. Instead of the mind has an impact on the body. Our bodies have several functions working while we are not moving, or sitting. Embodied cognition is the thought that our body help generate the process of being able to function without having to think about it. An example that comes to my mind is trying to give directions inside a building where all the walls are the same color and its very easy to get lost in. When trying to give directions it might be as simple as turn right then left but one might get that backwards. As if it was turn right at the purple wall, a little more detail might prevent one from getting lost. "
"Embodied cognition is part of the study of how our brains store and organize information. It is all the information that we know working together to complete something. One good example would be how I am typing this out right now. Many parts are working in my brain to help me type these words. Another good example would be folding a towel after it has been washed."
"Embodied cognition is the act of imaging something that creates the same brain activation as actually doing it. An example of this a outfielder in baseball and how they can catch a fly ball and know the right time and place that the ball will reach to catch that fly ball at the right moment. "
"Embodied cognition is the belief that our body and mind are related. Our environment plays a role in how we process information. "
"Embodied cognition is the belief that several components of human cognition are formed by facets of the body beyond the brain. An experiment was conducted in which there were three participants. The three participants were told to walk the same distance only here is the catch. One participant wore a Carmen Miranda costume while the other participants wore an assigned costume or no costume. Here is another catch, the person who wore the Carmen Miranda costume signed a freedom of choice consent form while the participant who wore the experimenters choice costume signed an experimenters choice consent form while the control participant did not sign a form. The Carmen Miranda imitator experienced cognitive dissonance and reported a shorter distance walked on a survey. A Carmen Miranda costume, a few steps taken and cognitive dissonance affected the perception of distance."
"Embodied cognition is the brain area involved in imagining doing an activity is the same as really doing them. An example of this is singing to yourself."
"Embodied cognition is the brain using certain parts that imagine things we picture ourselves doing. Such as me riding a bike I can imagine myself riding a bike. Also broca's area that is located in the frontal cortex is involved as well which is responsible for processing what we want to say. I can imagine myself speaking like Arnold Schwarzenegger."
"Embodied cognition is the concept that imagining a physical movement creates the same brain activity as actually doing the physical activity. For example, we did the Fitt’s Law experiment as a class. In part of that experiment we “imagined” that we were tapping the middle of the line and then the middle of the small, medium and large boxes to see how long it would take compared to how long it actually took us to actually do the physical activity of the tapping experiment."
"Embodied cognition is the concept that the different regions of the brain associated with a specific task or action will become activated when visualizing the process in the mind. One example of embodied cognition is swinging a bat. The region of the brain responsible for motor movement will become activated while visualizing the action. A second example of embodied cognition is replaying an argument while driving. The region associated with speech production, the Broca’s region, will become activated as you “win” your argument."
"Embodied cognition is the idea that cognition in humans is influenced by more than just the inner mind, but by other factors including interactions with the environment around us, our motor systems, and how we perceive things (or our ""perceptual systems"").  For example, in imagery, there is an idea known as the dual code theory that states that we remember information better if we encode it in two different ways into our brains.  For example, if I were to write a word down on one side of a notecard, and a picture representation of that word on the other side of the notecard, I would be encoding both verbally and visually."
"Embodied cognition is the idea that cognition is shaped entirely by the being and its environment. An example of this would be developmental psychology, which promotes the reasoning behind why and how people change over their lifetimes. The influence of environment and physical attributes can control physical, cognitive, and emotional development. "
"Embodied cognition is the idea that even if you imagine doing something physical, the part in your brain that would get activated during the physical activity, would still be activated just by imagining it. An example of this would be imagining folding your laundry. By imagining folding your laundry, the same part of your brain that would have been used to actually fold your laundry would still be activated."
"Embodied cognition is the idea that imagining yourself doing something is done by the area of the brain that is responsible for actually doing it. So if you are imagining playing a sport, the frontal lobe will be activated like it is actually stimulating the movements you are thinking of. This is because if you are actually playing the sport, this lobe is stimulating motor function. The more you are familiar with what you are trying to imagine, the faster you’re reaction time will be. This is due to the area being used to cause that action."
"Embodied cognition is the idea that many characteristics of the human perceptions are formed by features of the body beyond the brain. An example of embodied cognition is using body gestures and hands. This works by showing what goes on in our minds by our actions and interactions that is surrounding us."
"Embodied cognition is the idea that our mind can e influenced by our own body as well as our environment and our perception of the world around us. Our brain needs our body's perceptual systems as well as our motor systems. Our understanding of the world and our selves are based on how we percieve and sense our surroundings if we had different environment or different forms of perception our understanding of that environment would be different."
"Embodied cognition is the idea that our mind is linked to our entire body, rather than just to our brain. An experiment of this was done with a group of expert athletes. Expert baseball players were set up in a stimulator, similar to a will. They were asked to ""swing"" at the ball, and then rate how well they thought they hit the ball. The idea for this experiment was that these experts would be better at rating how well they hit the ball because they should have good motor imagery of themselves hitting the ball. This experiment failed however, because the players could not see themselves actually hit the ball which hindered their performance. But the idea of this theory still holds true with other athletes or performers. "
"Embodied cognition is the idea that simply imagining doing an action activates the same areas of the brain that are activated when actually doing that action. When a person engages in a specific type of cognition that requires pretending, the brain seems to act as if that pretend situation was real, which causes blood flow and electrical activity to increase in the area of the brain responsible for the imagined thing in reality. For example, asking someone to close their eyes and imagine one of their fears (e.g., spiders) in a room with them with no escape would cause the brain’s fear area—the amygdala—to be activated. In reality, the person is safe and not actually trapped in a room filled with spiders, but the brain’s complexity allows it to engage in such deep, imaginative thought that it is stimulated much in the same way as a real situation."
"Embodied cognition is the idea that the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe is active (as if it were actually doing the muscle movements) when imagining doing an action. An example of this would be imagining to braid someone's hair. Imagining to braid someone's hair is not a muscle movement, but the part of the brain responsible for muscle movement (the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe) would be active. "
"Embodied cognition is the idea that when people imagine doing something, the same parts of their brain are involved as if they actually were performing the action. The same brain regions being activated imply that the body impacts the way we think. Therefore, our ability to learn new concepts, solve problems, or take in knowledge does not involve just the brain but also our interactions with the physical world. For example, whenever a person drives a car, the cerebellum is activated allowing us to coordinate the movements of our hands and feet and remember how to perform the action. When we only imagine driving the car, the cerebellum is activated as though we truly were. This is due to the physical interaction we have previously had, such as using our hands in steering motions (gripping objects, arm movements), our feet and legs to place pressure on objects, etc."
"Embodied cognition is the idea that when you are imagining performing a task, the brain area that is in involved in doing the task is activated as if you’re actually doing it. My daughter likes to watch play dough egg videos on YouTube. Basically, a toy is place inside the egg and then the egg is wrapped in play dough. Then, as the video is filmed, the egg is uncovered and the prize is revealed. Through embodied cognition, my daughters brain is responding to the video as if she were uncovering the egg herself."
"Embodied cognition is the notion that, when you are asked to imagine doing something, the part of the brain that is involved in doing to activity is lit up as though you're actually doing it. For example, I play softball regularly as an outfielder. If someone were to ask me to explain how I catch a ball, I would first try to imagine doing the activity to better be able to explain it. When I imagine it, the part of my brain thats responsible for completing the action lights up as though I was actually catching a ball in the outfield."
"Embodied cognition is the occurrence where the brain uses the same region to imagine performing a task as when the task is physically carried out.  A couple of examples include when you are singing in your head or when you are imagining tying your shoes.  When you are singing in your head, the Broca’s area would light up during a fMRI scan just as it would if you were singing aloud during the same scan.    "
"Embodied cognition is the principal that the areas of the brain involved in performing a task are also involved when we imagine that we are performing the same task. This is shown in the experiment we performed when we timed ourselves jumping from the middle of a box to the middle of a line, and then timed ourselves while we imagined that we were doing the same task without actually doing it. The results showed the the time it took to imagine that we were performing the task was very close to the amount of time it took to actually complete the task."
"Embodied cognition is the process of activating the physical brain muscles associated with the imagined task, but not physically doing the task.Example would be activation of the occipital lobe muscles when imagining a movie that has been previously viewed."
"Embodied cognition is the process of how our brain can imagine doing a specific task, and this creates a sensation in the brain that can serve the same as actually doing it in your head. Things that almost require no studying in how to do like walking or tying a shoe, things we can do without thinking, but we asked to explain how to do them we have trouble describing what it is we are actually doing. "
"Embodied cognition is the regions in the brain involved in imagining things are the same as actually doing them."
"Embodied Cognition is the regions of the brain involved in imagining things are the same as actually doing them. An example of this is, being a dancer I like to think through my dances before I practice them. I have been dancing for fourteen years so I would say that I am an expert at dancing now. However, imagining I can do a certain move is completely different than actually doing the physical movement. In my mind I can do things well but when I go to actually do it, it doesn't actually go as smoothly. Like the expert baseball players in the Beilock experiment, they could imagine the baseball movement but they were not good at predicting their own performance."
"embodied cognition is the theory about how cognition is inclusive of not only mental process happening within our bodies but how our envoirment plays a role in cognitve processes. When making a desicion on something we don't just use information our brain has collected about the world and its output but we collectively take all the information including information about our perceptions to make the solutions. An example of this is kicking a kick ball. The brain asks the question of how can i kick this ball at the right time to hit it out of the field. The brain starts by using task analysis. It then collects data from its envoirment. Percieving how fast the ball is going and when it will arrive is involved in the collection of data. The output then comes to kick the ball when it is close to the plate by utilizing all the information given in the envoirment and in the brain logically as well. "
"Embodied cognition is the theory, and claim that the brain is not the only resource we have in our bodies to generate behaviors such as emotions and motor function. Instead, the embodied cognition theory suggests that we use active, real time, cognition within our nervous systems in accordance to the environments current physical stimuli to make decisions. The 'outfielder problem' would be an example where in theory, when a ball is hit into the outfield, the outfielder must perceive and predict where the ball is going to land. This requires information presented when the ball is hit such as speed and direction. The brain takes in this information using the information presented when the ball was hit and our bodies nervous system commands the fielder where to go when the ball will land. "
"Embodied cognition is thinking about doing something. For example, I can imagine myself doing a back flip. I am not physically doing a back flip, but my brain believes I am. We can imagine ourselves doing a lot of things but not really do them in real life."
"Embodied cognition is used by the same part of the brain as imagination. We imagine ourselves doing something without physically doing the action imagined. So we can just imagine something at random, it has to be information that has already been stored in our brain and what happens when we do the action. For example when I imagine kicking a ball into the goal there is the imagery of what form I am wanting to model to get the best kick and to aim at the perfect spot. "
"Embodied cognition is when a person is able to think or imagine doing something, an activity or a conversation in your head, that area of the brain that is required to work if you were to be doing the activated, is in fact activated even though you are just imagining doing that activity or having a conversation. One example of this would be if you were thinking about the action of driving to the store, that area of the brain would then be activated just as though you would actually be driving to the store. Another example of this would be if you were to be imagining yourself having a conversation with another person, that area of the brain (the left hemisphere where most language centers are located) would be activated or working even though you are just thinking of having that conversation with that person."
"Embodied cognition is when a person thinks about performing a procedural action and the neurons in his or her frontal lobe start firing like the person is actually performing this task. An example of this would be if a softball player was imagining throwing a ball. Neurons in her frontal lobes primary motor cortex would fire as if she was physically performing that action. "
"Embodied cognition is when an individual would imagine doing something, their brain area that is involved and activated when doing that activity is in turn stimulated, even though you are not currently physically doing it. An example of this would be when you ask someone to imagine ice skating, but not actively do it, with a bunch of monitors watching the regions of the brain that would enact skating, and seeing stimulation within the brain. "
"Embodied cognition is when imagining something is the same as actually doing it. It is the belief that features of human cognition are shaped by aspects of the body beyond the brain. An example of this would be singing or humming to yourself. "
"Embodied cognition is when parts of the brain are activated, as if you were doing something, by only imagining it. So imagining doing something is, in a sense, the same thing as actually doing that something, according to the brain. An example of embodied cognition is imagining shooting a basketball. When I was younger, I would envision shooting and making a shot. As I sat there and thought about using the right technique and shooting the ball, my brain was acting as if I was actually moving my body to do so. This is an action based example embodied cognition. I was not actually performing the sequences of shooting a basketball, but the parts of my brain required to do so were.  "
"Embodied cognition is when the brain region involved in performing certain motor skills lights up when you are imagining it as though your mind believes you are actually performing the motor task. For example, if you are imagining yourself riding a bike, so you are balancing, pushing the pedals, steering, etc. The parts of your brain involved in performing all of those tasks will be lit up while you are only imagining it. "
"Embodied cognition is when the mind is imagining doing something (such as brushing your teeth) and different parts of the brain have to basically construct those actions as if it actually were doing it. This is how we ""imagine"" per say."
"Embodied cognition is when the part of the brain that controls something is activated by imagining it. This is usually evaluated with fMRI testing, and an example of this would be when my volleyball coaches had us imagine a hitting approach before we would complete it. I would imagine my right foot going forward, crouching a little lower, throwing my arms back as I step with my left foot, throwing up my arms as I jump off of my right foot, swinging my right arm back, guiding with my left arm, and then snapping my wrist as I swing my arm all the way through the ball. We did this a lot with all of the very common procedures we had to master in volleyball. The idea is that if the brain is activated the same way by imagining it as doing it, then we should be able to improve this movement. Unfortunately this is not always true, but nevertheless the brain activation is there. "
"Embodied cognition is when you are imaging something you are doing. An example is when I  am imaging eating a big bowl of ice cream in my head because I am craving it."
"Embodied cognition is when you can imagine doing something, and this actually activates the same area of the brain as if you were actually doing it. An example of this was the baseball study done by Beilock. She had baseball players simulate hitting a ball, which would in turn activate the same brain area that they would use when actually hitting the ball. Even though this would stimulate the same area of the brain, the baseball players were not actually good at predicting their performance on the simulator."
"Embodied cognition is when you imagine doing something the same brain regions are stimulated as if you were doing the action. Say you were teaching someone how to braid their hair, but only doing it verbally. In your mind you are imagining braiding your own hair and saying out loud each step that you take. As you are doing this the same regions in the brain are involved even though you are not actually braiding you hair."
"Embodied cognition is when your brain imagines how to do something it works just as you where actually doing it. An example that was given within the class was tying your shoes when your brain does it and when you imagine doing it the brain works the same way."
"Embodied cognition is where the regions involved in the brain while imagining things are the same regions in the brain as doing that same things. It is the idea that imagining something creates the same brain activation as actually doing something. For example, when a baseball player goes to catch a ball in the air, some would think they need to make certain calculations in order for the player to catch the ball. However, the brain is imagining and perceiving where the ball is going to land, which allows the player to behave accordingly and to catch the ball where the ball will land. The player is using the area of his brain that imagines or perceives where the ball will go, while also using the same part of the brain that allows him to act accordingly and move towards where the ball will land."
"Embodied cognition is where you think about and plan what you want to do before you physically do it. "
"Embodied cognition means that our mind and body are related and function together as a result. Our environment and external experiences play a role in how our brains process information.  An example of how this works is if we learn to how to play a game, our mind may process this information differently because we are learning something through an external experience. "
"Embodied cognition shows the importance our bodies and environment play on our cognitive processes. An example of this would be making a decision or movement based off of what my body is sensing when laying upside down. "
"Embodied cognition states that the environment influences how we thing. Like how some people study better in complete silence and some people study better with music playing."
"Embodied Cognition the act of imagining something creates the same brain activation as actually doing it. So this could be being afraid of something that you are imagining verses it happening in real life your brain responds the same to the perceived fear you may have an increase in heart rate or sweating may occur."
"Embodied cognition, is the idea that cognition is the adaptation and cognitive development to the responses we have to our environment/entire body; a theory that suggest experiences shape our cognition. An example of this would be a showing a group of participants a series of pictures, and asking them to determine distance between objects. In some of the pictures a person might be present, or not. This idea is that individuals will ""assume"" the persons position and record that when the person was present they were closer to the object."
"Embodied cognition, which is another word for embodied mind thesis, can mean a numerous amount of things and looking at multiple studies, some people view it differently. From what I gathered from the notes, power points, and a little research online, embodied cognition is that the features of our cognition are made not only with our brain, but beyond it; almost like changing the duty of our brains. Our brains are used for understanding and containing knowledge, but now they are a part of a broader system which involves perception and action. It is another way for humans to demonstrate behavior with real-life experiences and offers more opportunities for us to act on those experiences. It allows us to ""go outside of the box"" or ""think outside of the box."" A perfect example of embodied cognition is if you were a soccer goalie. How can a goalie keep the ball from going inside the goal by being at the right place at the right time to block it? This is where perception comes in. The goalie has their eye on the soccer ball and moves their body in the direction that the ball is going, telling their mind that if their eyes and body follow the ball, that they will be able to catch the ball and keep it from going inside the ball. So in this situation, the brain is not only giving us knowledge of the sport, where the ball is, and where we need to be, but using embodied cognition to help the goalie get to the ball. A real life experience and our bodies and brains are directing us to a certain direction to perform a certain task. "
"Embodied cognition:  is the belief that many features of human cognition are shaped by the aspects of the body even beyond the brain. The mind beyond the body. Embodied cognition example:  How the environment affects us.  If I have no money because I have no job how will I afford to feed myself? "
"Everyone at one time has witnessed a group of people doing the Mexican wave, either it be at a sporting event or concert. One person can raise their arms and lay them back down and everyone beside them will carry on doing the same thing.The Mexican wave can actually help explain action potentials in the nervous system. The nervous system are filled with cells called neurons that carry out electric impulses. The message to take action starts by going in the neuron through the dendrites. Then, they make it through to the cell body. The message then presses on through the axon of the neuron where myelin sheaths help speed up the process. Axon terminals are the very last stop on the neuron where the message can be sent on to the next neuron. Between the  different neurons is called a synapse.  When the message is being sent on a neurotransmitter it  goes from the terminals to receptors on the next neuron. The whole process is like the contagious Mexican wave where it keeps on going and going.The frontal lobe is where the Broca's area is located. Broca's area is where speech and language processes happen. Broca's area is also where embodied cognition happens. You have to imagine yourself doing the wave before you actually do it."
"Feature matching theory matches general characteristics of an object and groups them together.  This is an example of features being combined with memory to group objects together. Whereas, top down uses senses and short cuts to form our perceptions, like the theory used in word superiority where a specific letter is seen differently in our minds depending on the surrounding letters.  All group information together but do it differently."
"Feature matching theory suggests that when we are looking at an object, we focus our attention to processing the most simple and characteristic attributes of that object. This allows us to familiarize ourself with the object by creating a perception based on the attributes and familiar details of that object, which is bottom up processing. If we were to use top down processing, we would instead look into the context of the object to place perception, such as in the lecture with the desks at Texas Tech. When you first look at the picture, you see a desk in which you could spend time studying and doing schoolwork, but if you were told that instead you were shown this in reference to WW2, you would see that the desks were in the shape of a swastika. Word processing theory is similar to top down processing in the aspect that we use assumptions and expectations to create perception. We are able to read misspelled and jumbled words because of this expectation that we have about what is supposed to be there. "
"For me I would think the worst lobe to break would be Temporal Lobe because it not only controls hearing, which is not the end of the world but I would miss hearing things. This lobe also controls memory and losing my memory would be why this would be the worst one to break in my opinion because you would not be able to remember your life and memories are very important to me."
"For this section, we discussed attention. Attention is defined as a process that has the ability to increase or decrease the information that person is receiving. One of the experiments that completely alters your state of attention that was discussed was change blindness, which is when a person’s attention has failed to detect changes that may have happened in their environment and go unnoticed. There are many different experiments and examples of this phenomenon happing such as watching video of people passing a basketball, and you are to focus on the number of passes they complete. While your attention is increased on counting the number of passes, your attention is also decreased on being able to notice a gorilla passing through the game of pass. Another topic discussed in this section that sort of goes along with that phenomenon is Posner’s cueing paradigm. In this task, you are to be fixated on looking at a cross and they may begin adding in other shapes. When the shape is in the same spot, you are quicker at noticing that spot (exogenous attention), than if it were to have moved you would be much slower (endogenous attention). Your endogenous attention is more controlled and is much harder to do because you are looking at it in more of a context base and it is much slower to think in those terms. Like when you are looking for your mom in the store when she runs off to look at the purses. You have a much harder time looking for those distinctive features of your mom in an isle filled with purses and people rather than just shouting her name and getting her attention."
"frontal lobe -  area of the brain important for voluntary movements, cognitive functioning, speech. "
"Frontal Lobe: The anterior part of the brain. Controls motor movements as well as abstract thought processes. One of last parts to mature. "
"The frontal lobe of our brain controls our attention, helps us to focus and use our judgements.  It also controls our muscle movement.  The Broca’s area is located within the frontal lobes, on the left side near the ear, and helps with speech production that helps us to respond to what we are hearing.  All of these things wouldn’t be possible without the neurons in our brain firing and sending signals to other parts of our bodies.  Neurotransmitters are the end result of the action potential.  When the electric signal is sent through the axon, the neurotransmitters are released into the synapse and are bound to receptors that fit together with it, causing the chemical communication.  The way the representation of how the neurons communicate within the brain.  As the neurons fire, it sends the action potential through the “Mexican Wave” to be received by other neurons."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception to understand how our environment and how we give meaning to things.  Our perception of things defines how we act toward it and what type of sensation will come from it.  If our perception of something is that it is dangerous or harmful, and our sensation outcome is the same than we will know to avoid those situations."
"The ability for our brain to focus our attention on something is a process of focusing or concentrating on a specific part of a piece of information or object while ignoring other parts that don’t interest us.   The ability to hold our attention can be automatic and reflexive (Exogenous), a controlled attention caused by a sudden change in our sight.  For example when we “see something out of the corner of our eye” that causes a focus change.  Or our attention can be innate (Endogenous) and intentional.  We focus this type of attention on something we want or desire.  The ability to hold our attention is based on these types of cues.  The Posner’s cuing paradigm (1984) was a study over these types of attention.  This study theorized that exogenous cues given peripherally would benefit the subjects’ performance.   It measured reaction times to particular cues and what subject’s paid attention to.  This is also seen in the change blindness phenomena.  This is similar because we don’t realize when certain things that we are looking at change.  We are focused on other objects and since the changes don’t interest us or are so subtle that they don’t catch our eye, we simply miss them.  "
"Cognitive psychology started in the 1870’s with the “Father of Cognition” Wilhelm Wundt in his lab in Leipzig, Germany.  With Wundt’s student Titchener and their team, they felt that psychology needed to be based more within the person; and felt that mental activity needed to be more objective.  They wanted to learn why people think the way they do. "
"The birth of Cognitive psychology led us to this point in history.  Scientists conducted several experiments on the human brain and were curious about how we think and develop our thought processes.  Specifically on how our thought processes developed and worked.  The need to find the link between the mind and the brain led to several studies to help us understand that the brain is the computer and the mind is the results that come out of what we put into it. These new findings in cognitive psychology and revelations on the mind-brain allowed us to conduct research in artificial intelligence.  This was born out of our advanced curious desires to see if electrical objects can perform with the same thought processes as a human.  With the advancement in our society, we have found ways to manipulate a computer to function and think like a human.  "
"Embodied Cognition is a part of cognitive science that theorizes the role that your environment plays in the development of your cognitive processes.  The theory states that as the body influences the mind, the mind influences the body.  That our thought processes are possibly determined by our experiences in the world we live in. The interaction between our brain and body determine our behavior. "
"The ways in which our brain process information from our environment are as complex as the brain itself.  Our brain uses certain approaches and patterns to detect and process the information to make it coherent.  There are two main approaches that we use.  The top-down approach uses our knowledge and expectations of the big picture to help make sense of the smaller things. Our perception is formed by this top-down processing.  When we are trying to figure out the bigger picture of something, we use the bottom-up approach.   Information is based on what we receive from the environment, detailed and formed to a larger idea or perception.  Our depth perception works on this approach.  Word superiority effect (WSE) works in the bottom-up processing as well.  People have a better ability to recognize letters presented within words than individually or nonsense words.  These tests also showed that the processing of information in our brain is happening at the same time and in different neural areas. This is also the case with the feature matching theory.  We can more easily define objects by searching for simple but characteristic features of an object. As long as we feel something is important, we will retain the characteristics for further use. "
"Cognitive maps are your “mental maps” of the layout of your environment.  The Route Maps help you navigate from one area to another.  These routes are specific in directions, like a GPS, but relies on your mental interpret the environment.  I use my cognitive maps to drive from my home to work and to school and get there in a timely manner.  But sometimes will take different routes that I remember to get back home.  "
"One of the experiments we talked about was the Fitt’s Law.  It is based on the theory that if a space (or square) is larger, compared to a smaller area (or square) that it would take more time to tap the center and go back to the original starting position.  With each size of quare the time would increase due to more area available and precision to hit the center.  The DV’s are the times that it takes to hit the sets of lines and the boxes.  The IV’s are the sets of lines and boxes.  The groups are the sets of varying sizes of squares and lines.  "
"The lobe of the brain that would be the worst if broken would be the Frontal lobes.  This part of the brain is responsible for your decision making, judgement and thinking.  Not to mention your planning processes as well as holding your personality.  The Broca’s area is also held here which controls your speech production.  This area would be incredibly devastating to me if it were to be damaged.  "
"The brain is made up of a complex system of nerve cells called neurons that communicate through electrical impulses to release, or inhibit, important chemicals called neurotransmitters. There are two main types of neurons, excitatory and inhibitory, which have different functions within the brain, although not all of the functions are well understood by neuroscientists. The way in which inhibitory neurons communicate, though, has been described as similar to a Mexican Wave. Much like spectators at a sporting event encourage others to do ‘the wave’, inhibitory neurons have mechanisms that can encourage other neurons near them to imitate them, which causes wave-like activity across the brain. The frontal lobe is the most anterior lobe of the brain, located just behind the frontal bone, or forehead. This lobe of the brain is responsible for the “higher” cognitive functions like problem solving, empathetic behavior, spatial orientation and social interaction. Another important function of the frontal lobe happens in an area called Broca’s Area. Broca’s Area is involved in the complex system of speech, which also incorporates other areas of the brain like the temporal and motor cortexes. In particular, Broca’s Area is active right before words are spoken, indicating that it mostly contributes to speech production. It would make sense, then, as to why damage to Broca’s Area would result in poor speech production."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because at surface level they seem very similar, but perception is really a higher functioning ability and involves interpreting sensory information as ambiguous, overwhelming or insufficient. For example, if you walk into a crowded bar and are looking for a group of friends you are likely overwhelmed by a large amount of sensory information, much of which is unnecessary in finding your friends. However, through your abilities of perception, you can pick out a familiar friend’s laugh or a familiar face in order to find your group. "
"The concept of attention, from a cognitive neuroscience perspective, is the complex network of information processing within the brain that causes some information to be enhanced over others. What Posner’s cueing paradigm shows is that visual resources are limited and when attention is cued to one location, the target stimulus is more likely to be missed if the cued location is incorrect. However, if the cued location is the same as the target stimulus location, then the stimulus is more likely to be correctly identified. This paradigm is more easily explained through the idea of change blindness. If a participant is told to watch a certain scene where there is a lot of different stimuli going on simultaneously, it is impossible for someone to pay equal attention to every aspect of that scene. Because of this, the phenomenon of change blindness is likely to happen, which is when a change occurs that the subject is unaware of, or “blind” to. However, if you were were to enter a party and be looking for someone in particular, you would be using  endogenous attention, also called controlled attention. Continuing with the party example, if you walk in the party and look for your friend you are likely to scan the room and look for someone who fits the basic description of your friend. This is all done without cognitively working through every step, but if your friend is tall, female, blonde-haired and blue eyed, you would look quickly around the room for these basic characteristics. If the room is full of mostly males, you would likely find your friend quickly, but if the room is full of tall, blonde-haired females, the search would be more difficult. In the latter case, you would have to look more closely at the womens’ faces to determine if any of them were your friend. All this to say that there is a lot going on “behind the scenes” when we attend to stimuli from our environment, but these abilities are important and serve us constantly. "
"The field of cognitive psychology has a main focus of understanding the way humans process information, and this is studied by looking at how humans treat, and choose to react to, stimuli from the environment. Most all cognitive psychologists use laboratory experiments to study behavior because cognitive psychology is a science and uses the scientific approach. This field also tends to draw a lot of comparisons between how humans process information and how computers process information because there are a lot of similarities between the two. One interesting area of study that deals directly with computer and human information processing is artificial intelligence, which is the development of computers to be intelligent machines. Most people would consider computers to be intelligent already, but there are many ways in which computers fail, or are less efficient, at tasks that humans are better at. The aim of this area of study is essentially to make computer programs that can solve real-world problems as well as, if not better than, humans. Another interesting area of study associated with cognitive psychology is the subject of the “mind-brain.” Ever since mental functioning has been localized in the brain, this idea of a “mind” that is separate from the brain has become more prevalent. There are two main theories associated with the “mind-brain” concept: one states that the mind is just a product of brain processes, and the other states that the mind has non-physical properties that separate it from the brain as an entirely different entity. "
"One type of brain research is the correlational neural method which show what areas of the brain are functioning at a given time, also called localization. An example of a correlational neural method of research would be positron emission tomography, more commonly known as a PET scan. "
"In regards to information processing, cognitive psychologists have identified two main approaches and they are top-down and bottom-up processing. Top-down processing refers to the use of knowledge and/or expectations to guide processing whereas bottom-up processing refers to piecing together smaller bits of information to form a “bigger picture. There are many theories associated with the two approaches to processing, one of which is the feature matching theory. The feature matching theory is a bottom-up processing theory which proposes the idea that we break down visual images into a set of features that we then match against features stored in our memory. We use this database of features to process and determine what we are seeing. This theory is often explained using the recognition of letters, which is something all literate humans are familiar with. Another phenomenon related to the recognition of letters is the word superiority effect. The word superiority effect states that letters are more accurately recognized if they are within a word rather than isolated or within a nonword (a string of letters that are unpronounceable). This can also apply to pseudowords, or words that are close to a real word but not exact like “wster” or “wator” in comparison to “water”.  "
"Cognitive psychology started in the laboratory of Wilhelm Wund in Germany, and it started being researched when technology like computers made it possible to observe and test mental functioning. "
"giesler 6. One experiment we did was the Chimeric Faces experiment, which studied the lateralization of information processing to either the right or left hemisphere of the brain. Based upon the individual’s Lateralization Quotient (LQ) score, he or she was right-hemisphere dominant, left-hemisphere dominant or neither (no lateralization). We also utilized the information of right or left-hand dominance, because typically right-handed individuals have left-hemisphere dominance and left-handed individuals have right-hemisphere dominance. The independent variable was the right or left hand dominance, and the dependent variable was the lateralization quotient, which was decided through the chimeric faces demo. "
"I would say that the frontal lobe would be the worst one to damage because it is involved in our higher functioning processes and if damaged, would have the widest array if symptoms. For example, if this lobe were damaged, you likely could not speak or move as well, and your memory, impulse control, judgment, and problem solving abilities would be severely diminished. "
"A person’s ability to shift their attention can be measured by Posners cueing paradigm, by using visual cues.   The pupils of the eyes are fixed up a cue which is in the central or peripheral view and is measured by their shift of the eyes to another object."
"hemphill 1      Damage to the Brocas area located in the cerebral cortex, usually in the left hemisphere in the frontal lobe of the brain, causes different kinds of language problems. The frontal lobe is the largest part of the brain and is located in front of the parietal lobe and above the temporal lobe. Inside of the brain there are neurotransmitters that communicate by transmitting messages from one neuron to another through the synapse. The transmitters are either turned on or off according to the chemical receptor it bonds with. The receptors communicate in a sequence, like the Mexican wave at a ball game, where one person stands up and others follow them to imitate the movement of a wave rd. Chemical imbalances can cause the neurons to be excitedly or turned and the inhibitory or off in incorrect order. Stroke patients with damage to the Broncos area experience unbalanced firing of the neurons, causing speech and language problems. These patients have a problem putting words together to communicate and understand what is being said.    "
"hemphill 2      Attention is the cognitive process which filters the new information from our sensory memory and limits the amount of input that enters the brain, to avoid memory overload. Attention is very important in retaining and recalling information because it allows sensations to be compared, by its features and to be categorized into perceptual patterns.  Our senses, sight, hearing, taste and touch, stimulate are extra large amount of information and not all of it can be passed into memory. Selective attention allows us to voluntarily choose the information we want to remember by concentrating on what is important. The bottleneck theory suggests the information we receive is filtered by interference, so some sensations are blocked Attention consists of two components exogenous and endogenous. The two components attend to different stimulus. Endogenous attention is where we voluntarily direct our attention to a specific activity or object, consciously. Exogenous is involuntary, like hearing a loud noise. An example of how our attention filters information is change blindness, which occurs when something changes in our visual space and we do not notice the change.   This is because there is already too much stimulus in the brain and it the sensory change can't be processed A person’s ability to shift their attention can be measured by Posners cueing paradigm, by using visual cues.  These patients have a problem putting words together to communicate and understand what is being said.    "
"hemphill 3     Cognitive psychology is the study of the mind-brain.   The mind-brain refers to the relationship between the mind s way of thinking, reasoning, and remembering and the brains functions.   Computers have come a long way in simulating the human mind, since Newell and Simon in the 1950’s .Cognitive scientists use the computer to better understand the mind- brain relationship by experimentation.     Experiments start with a theory and set up a hypothesis and a procedure to verify the validity of the proposed idea.  The experiments have a causal effect which means that an event has a cause which affects a second event. In the experiments they have an independent and dependant variable.   The cause is the manipulation of a situation which is the independent variable and the effect is the measurement of light, and sounds are examples of the dependent   variable.  Variable Cognitive psychology likes to use computers to simulate the human brain by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine to copy human behavior well enough to fool someone into believing they are actually communicating with another human.  Advancements in artificial intelligence may someday give us the answers to helping individuals with learning disabilities and stroke patients."
"hemphill 4     The process of learning can be put into two categories, top-down and bottom-up. The way we input new information into our memory is through the brains interpretation of the sensations we receive and our past experience. What we see, hear, feel or touch is direct information that input into our memory and that is called bottom up processing and it is external driven attention... The knowledge we already have and our experiences can influence the brains interpretation of new information and is called top-down processing.  Word superiority, that we have better recognition of words compared to just using letters in the top down processing.  This is used in parallel processing.  Parallel processing speeds up the visual and linguistic in the sensory memory to be interrelated by the brain.  Feature processing also speeds up the brain in its perceptions by using similar features of objects.  The features are then categorized and stored into memory for quicker recall of information."
"hemphill Cognitive mapping is a mental image used to demonstrate how the mind processes our daily activities.  The parallel map theory is two separate maps together.  Maps use shape, orientation and spatial relations to compare to our daily activities. "
"hemphill Cognitive psychologist studies sensation and perception because they are the backbone of our reality.  They are studied because sensations influence people’s perceptions of what is going on in the world.  An example of the reason is a person who suffers from epilepsy.  Epilepsy causes seizures and disrupts a person’s daily activity and negatively effects how they perceive their world.  It would be great one day if epilepsy was no more because of cognitive research of sensation and perception."
"hemphill Cognitive psychology started in Germany by Wilhelm Wundt when he opened the first experimental laboratory.   Hall, who was a student of Wundt, brought experimentation to the United States lab at Johns Hopkins University.    Several types of psychology came before Cognitive, like functionalism, psychoanalysis, structuralism and behaviorism.  The magic number by Miller started to change psychology and is noted for the application of a cognitive approach.  , was the first as a philosophy of the mind and biologist study of the brain. Cognitive really made its appearance 1950 by Newell and Simon.  The simulated the first human mind, with a machine."
"hemphill The bottle-neck theory of attention suggests that the information that goes into the working memory is filtered by the narrowing of the area that sensations go to before they are processed by the brain.  The area that narrows is located between the sensory memories and long-term in the working memory.  The filtering of the sensations is necessary so the brain can process information instead of becoming overload "
"hemphill The Turing experiment was an experiment to see if human intelligence can be imitated by a computer.  Decision-making and reasoning is what is used to determine intelligence.  If an artificial intelligence could carry on a conversation which included these abilities, than a person would believe they were talking with something with intelligence.  The purpose of this experiment was to see if we could tell the difference between communicating with Katy and the computer.  It wasn’t much of an illusion though because the computer didn’t fool me. "
"There are two ways our brain is called to pay attention to things.  Exogenous attention is when outside stimuli demands the brain pay attention.  Things such as loud noises, when someone calls your name, or even bright colors signal our brain to involuntary pay attention to it.  But endogenous attention is attention that is internally controlled.  This is when we choose what we pay attention to voluntarily, such as looking for a friend in a crowd or picking out a certain instrument in a song.  Posner showed this difference between the voluntary and involuntary attention in his cueing paradigm.  Participants in his study were asked to pick out a target in various trials.  In each trial there was also a cue before, sometimes in the exact spot where the target would later appear and sometimes in a different spot.  In the times where the cue was in the same spot, the participants showed exogenous, or involuntary, attention by being drawn to the spot by the cue and then not having to move attention when the target appeared.  But when the cue was different, the participant was forced to voluntarily move attention from the wrong spot to wherever the target was.  But, the brain is not always perfect in what it decides to “select” to attend to.  Change blindness is when the brain is focused on some other stimuli that it does not process changes happening in the environment.  This happens a lot in movies when we are focused on what’s in the foreground and don’t necessarily notice the changes happening in the background. "
"The trouble with early psychology arouse when psychologists tried to measure and observe the “mind” part through the idea of introspection, which many argued was impossible to accurately measure or understand.  Thus when cognitive psychology officially began in the 1950s, it was more on the side of studying the brain or the “hardware” in order to make inferences about the “software” or the mind.  Cognitive psychology began in tandem with the development of the computer, which in turn was used to try and explain the idea of cognition.  Much of the research in the beginning had a lot to do with artificial intelligence and trying to create models for how people work.  It was not necessarily about making a “fake” human, but using artificial intelligence to try to predict and understand how the human brain operates.Because psychology (and the subfield of cognition) is a science, psychologists perform research in order to make discoveries about how cognition works.  Much of the research involves running experiments to look for causal relationships between variables.  Independent variables are the one controlled by the researcher and manipulated in order to observe dependent variables that are measured.  "
"hickman 1. Sensation is merely the raw data that or the sensory input that comes into our brain.  But perception is the next step, how the brain understands and makes sense of the raw data.  Are sense are constantly being stimulated, but if our brain attended to it all then it would be overloaded.  We cannot make coherent perceptions of all of the sensory information at any given time.  It’s also important to make this distinction as an explanation of the same sensory input for two different people leading to two different perceptions.  "
"hickman 2. Bottleneck theory of attention postulates that because the brain can’t process a lot of information at one time so it will sequentially attend to information a little bit at a time.  The important information that can’t go unprocessed will be processed one at a time in a certain order.  "
"hickman 3.  Behavioral brain research is observing external behavior to make inferences about what’s going on inside the brain.  Posner’s cueing paradigm and other search tasks are examples of behavioral research, taking the behaviors asked of the participant (finding the target) and making inferences based on the ability to do the task about what the brain might be doing to get those results. "
"hickman 6. Sian Beilock’s athlete experiment was trying to determine how athletes brain’s worked, specifically regarding motor cognition.  She compared two groups of athletes, hockey players and football players by showing them the same set of sentences and images participants were asked to tell if it matched or didn’t.  The sentences either matched the football player’s expertise, the hockey player’s expertise, or were neutral.  The sentence type, matching or not matching, is the independent variable, as well as whether or not the sentence was in the participant’s “expertise”.  The dependent variable, what she was testing for, was how long it took for the participant to answer.  The study found that sentences that matched image were answered faster, and also the sentences that were in the participant’s “expertise” were answered faster than the neutral or nonmatching sentences.  This is an example of embodied cognition that having more experience in the motor tasks enabled the brain to more quickly identify the task being presented. "
"hickman 7.  Although having any of the lobes damaged, I would think having the temporal broken would be the most aggravating and isolating.  It is the part of the brain associated with hearing, and the Wernicke’s area is that part that processes what is being heard.  Having the ability to hear people’s words but not understand what they were saying would be frustrating.  Along with that the fusiform gyrus is responsible for facial recognition, so without this ability everyone looks like a stranger. "
"hickman 8. The Ebbinghaus illusion is an example of relative size perception.  Two circles of the same size are each surrounded by other circles, one with larger circles and the other with smaller circles.  The circle surrounded by the smaller circles often appears larger when compared to the same size circle surrounded by bigger circles.  The inability to recognize that they are the same size shows that the size perception process is temporarily broken due to the surrounding visual cues distorting this process.  "
"hickman In understanding perception, there are two key processes to look at.  Bottom up processing is based on sensory information and trying to perceive based on the information presented.  An example of how this may work can be seen in the feature matching theory of recognition.  This theory suggests that when we are looking at an object, the brain will break it down into its features and then in turn try to match that with features stored in the memory.  It is driven by the visual stimuli, the sensory information, to try and perceive what it is we are seeing.  Top down processing, on the other hand, uses context information and is driven by internal goals or expectations.  This can be seen through the phenomenon of word superiority.  Even if a word is completely misspelled, if the first and last letters are in the right place, our brains will take the information and mentally put it in the right order to read it.  We have previous knowledge of how the word is supposed to look and as long as all of the expected stimuli are there, we can make sense of it. "
"hickman Once the impulse reaches the axon terminals (or terminal buttons), it signals the release of a neurotransmitter.  Neurotransmitters are responsible fore the intra-neuron communication, carrying the message across the synaptic cleft and binding to the receptor sights of the other neuron’s dendrites.  These neurons make up the nervous system, which is split into two parts.  The central nervous system includes the spinal chord and the brain.  The brain can be split into four different lobes, the occipital, the parietal, the temporal, and the frontal.  At the back of the frontal lobe is the primary motor cortex, which controls movement.  Neurons in the brain signal (via the “Mexican Wave” and neurotransmissions) the neurons in the peripheral nervous system that runs through the whole body and in turn can stimulate muscles to move.  At the front of the frontal lobe is the prefrontal cortex that is responsible for both focus and abstract thinking.  On the side of the frontal lobe is another important area called Broca’s that is important for speech production.  "
"I already used this example in one of our discussion posts, I believe, but I can not imagine not having my sight. Yes, breaking ANY lobe would be horrible and lessen our abilities to preform. However, if I broke my occipital lobe and couldn't view this world and all the things it has to offer, I would go crazy. That is rude to say, because I know there are many blind people in our world who preform perfectly well and have learned to live without sight. But to go from being able to see everything in life for 23 years and all the sudden have that ripped away, I would be mortified. "
"I am a huge fan of my memory and I have been told that I have a very good memory.  Therefore, I would not want the temporal lobe to break.  I believe, in my opinion, that would be the worst lobe to break.  If it were to break I would lose the use of my memory because it is connected to the hippocampus.  I would also loose my memory of faces and would not longer be able to recognize faces.  I believe this would be the worst lobe to break.  "
"I believe one of the worst lobes to lose would be either the Frontal or Parietal lobes. The frontal lobe is in change of most of your personality as well and your moods while your Parietal lobe is in charge of how you interpret your sensory information  as well as visual information and is in charge with your perception of your on body and the world around you. either way both of these I believe would be the worst to lose while the occipital lobe may be the least worse, it deal with vision in which many people on earth are currently blind and are able to live fairly normal lives and have adapted to their condition so losing this lobe would be horrible but still livable. "
"I believe that breaking the frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to break. There are many reasons that breaking the frontal lobe would be devastating, but four of the most important to me are personality, motor movement, speech production, and abstract thinking. Damage to the frontal lobe can result in personality change. Personality is what makes everyone different when it comes to thinking, behaving, and functioning in everyday life. A break to the frontal lobe could result in a person having completely different views, opinions, characteristics, etc. Breaking the frontal lobe would damage the motor cortex and result in the inability to move parts or sides of the body. Being unable to move would be frustrating and inconvenient. Next, Broca’s area, part of the frontal lobe, is in control of speech production. Breaking the frontal lobe would result in the lack of ability to fluently speak. Without speech production, one would be unable to voice their opinion or even converse with a friend or family member. With the lack of speech production, everyday life would become much more difficult. Lastly, abstract thinking is credited to the frontal lobe. The inability to think on a deeper level or reflect upon things would ultimately be the most devastating blow to breaking the frontal lobe. Losing the frontal lobe would result in an inability of many cognitive functions, but the four mentioned are why I believe that it would be the worst lobe to break."
"I believe that the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe's processes are what I believe to be some of the most important brain processes. From motor skills to abstract thinking, attention, and speech, the frontal lobe contains the processes that make us the most human. Without it, we would have no ability to pay attention or speak, much less control our bodies. "
"I believe the frontal lobe would be the worse one to break. So many important parts of who ""you are"" reside in the frontal lobe. Personality, the ability to think, to hold attention on what's important, and the Broca's area, which allows you to speak. Without these aspects, I'm not sure if one would really have a life. You would be someone completely different than who you were, and would not be able to gain new skills as you couldn't focus on important areas that you want to learn. An example of this was Phineas Gage, who lost many friends, and his job, when he damaged his frontal lobe.  "
"I enjoyed learning about change blindness.  Change blindness is the limited attention on anything beyond the visual space and information involved for processing.  This is in relation to focus and attention.  When a person is focused into a task, activity or movie (as we used in class), the external factors may not be noticed or the information is not retained. "
"I enjoyed the Face perception adaption illusion we learned about in Module 4. I believe the organization step is the process that is broken during this illusion. Our brains adapt to picture the longer we look at them. We process only what we see in the Occipital lobe and the morphed face becomes almost like a temporary “norm”."
"I feel that the worst lobe of the brain to be damaged would be the temporal lobe. The temporal lobe in in control of functions relating to hearing. I feel that specifically with damaging the Wernicke's area, it would be difficult to be able to speak but not understand what their response is. Communication couldn't exist in this situation."
"I feel the parietal lobe would be one of the worst to break/damage. It controls sensations and spatial processing as well as managing memory. Without it you may not feel pain, be able to balance, nor remember as much!"
"I may be partially biased as a speech pathology major when I say that in my opinion the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. There are parts of your frontal lobe on the left hemisphere where part of your language center is located (broca's area) that are super important for speech production. If you were to break that part of your lobe you would have much difficulty producing speech and getting out what you want to say. The frontal lobe is also very important in terms of making you, you. It's primary function is emotions and personality. I again may be biased when I say that I think this would be the worst place to break because my dad recently diagnosed with a tumor on his frontal lobe on his right hemisphere, and I am afraid he may experience some changes in who he is and that is something I would never want. I've also known of cases where patients suffered high velocity impact wounds in the frontal lobe region, and their personalities and emotions just went haywire.There is also the famous case of Phineas Gage who suffered a rod piercing his skull and injuring his frontal lobe. People that knew him said he was longer the same person he was before the injury. I think it would be so devastating and hard to have known someone or be that someone and be a completely different being than you once were. Overall, breaking any lobe in the brain would extremely terrible and difficult because all of the lobes work together to make you functionally normally and make you human. "
"I personally think that the frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to break. I believe that the frontal lobe is the worst to break because even the smallest amount of damage to the frontal lobe can create huge damage. The frontal lobe controls problem solving, impulse control, motor function, judgment, language, memory, and social and sexual behaviors.  In my opinion without your frontal lobe you would be a vegetable because you would not be able to do much. If you broke you frontal lobe you would most likely become paralyzed because it controls motor function. "
"I think it is interesting that a reaction to this question and the subsequent attempts to answer this question is an answer to the question in itself. On the surface the question appears to be a rather simple question to answer what is the link between the key terms. I found myself experiencing a mild sense of frustration when i could not produce an immediate answer. Rather then giving into my frustration I said out loud ""calm down and answer the question."" The link between the key terms is the Broca's area is area of the brain that is responsible for language production and research has shown that it also plays a part in language comprehension as well. The Broca's area is located in the frontal lobe of the brain, which is  an area of the brain that plays a role in attention and plays a role in regulating appropriate responses to current situations. Whether the decision to ""calm down and answer the question"" is open for discussion at a later date and scenario but the Broca's area either produced that response or reacted to a decision made by the frontal lobe. GABA, which is inhibitory neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger produced by neurons most likely played an role in the calming process. Since GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter it is likely that it functions in accordance with inhibitory neurons, which possess the ability to vibrate and send messages to other inhibitory neurons. The phenomenon in which inhibitory neurons respond and send messages to nearby inhibitory neurons is called The Mexican Wave."
"I think that the frontal lobe would be the worst one to break. The frontal lobe is where our motor functions and movements come from. Without it, we would essentially be paralyzed. "
"I think that the worst lobe to break would be your temporal lobe. The temporal lobe's functions are visual memories, Wernicke's area which is for comprehending languages, and the process of input from the ears. First of all not having a memory would not be fun because we retain things that we learn to make us a better person or who we are and also the thought of not being able to recognize someone of your family would be awful. I am a huge family person so that would be so sad. Another reason why I think that breaking the temporal would be the worst is not being able to comprehend language. This is how we all communicate with each other so without that it would be hard to go about life. Then to top it all off not being able to hear just is the kicker for the rest of it. Not only can you not remember or communicate languages, you can't even hear to have some part of life to enjoy. Temporal lobe would by far be the worst!"
"I think the frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to have broken. The frontal lobe controls things like our short term memory, emotion, voluntary movement, social functioning, creativity, and expressive language. If your emotions and social functioning were broken the things that would normal make you laugh, smile, or feel joy wouldn’t work anymore. If our social functioning didn’t work, we wouldn’t be able to get along with other people successfully. Living without our creativity and expressive language would be like living without a personality. Without our voluntary movement we would be bound to a bed or wheelchair unable to move on our own. These few things controlled by the frontal lobe describe the essential needs of my personality to live a happy life. Without them I am sure you could still be alive, but would it be really living, not in my opinion."
"I think the frontal lobe would be the worst one to break. If you break this area you are not able to use judgment, organize information, control muscle movement, and other cognitive functions.  All of these items in which you would hurt by damaging this area are what you utilize on a daily bases thus making the normal things in life much more difficult should it break."
"I think the frontal lobe would be the worst to break. There's too much vital processing that goes on this area and would not be something anyone would want to damage. In this lobe, there's the primary motor and prefrontal cortices that are responsible for controlling muscles and attention. This lobe also has the Broca's, which was mention that is responsible for speech production. This lobe functions as the source for abstract thinking and judgement. I wouldn't want to lose this lobe or damage it in any way because then I wouldn't be able to understand the world around me. This part isn't responsible for memory, which could be a problem, but it is responsible for the processing of information and the interaction with the outside world. At least if you still had this you could most likely take care of yourself, or do a lot of things still on your own. You'd also have a ""personality"" because this is where your abstract thinking is formed and it would allow you to think beyond regular functioning.   "
"I think the lobe that would be the worst to break would be the frontal lobe. This lobe contains that primary motor cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and Broca’s area. So, without the frontal lobe, you could not move, you could not focus or think abstractly, and you could not respond to what someone is telling you or asking you."
"I think the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. I think it would fine to lose hearing or eyesight, but I think our quality of life would decrease dramatically without a functioning frontal lobe. I don’t think that I would want to live in a rigid state with no muscle movement. The ability to move myself through the world and interact with the things that my senses pick up is probably what makes life so beautiful to live. On that same note, I am able to attend to those things my senses pick up and losing that ability furthers my argument because I am less likely to interact with them."
"I think the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for managing so many things in our day-to-day lives such as behavior and our ability to communicate and understand communication. The frontal lobe also contains the Broca's area which is responsible for understanding and interpreting speech. If I broke that lobe, I would not be able to understand and communicate with those around me. Being able to communicate is important to maintain relationships and for others to be able to understand our needs and wants and without a lobe that allows us to do so we could not do these things. "
"I think the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. This lobe is used for higher processes things like emotion, thinking, problem solving, parts of speech and reasoning. You use this part of your brain every day. Without it we wouldn't be able to function. Something as simple as studying for this test wouldn't be possible without the frontal lobe. In my opinion i also feel as though life wouldn't be worth it without the frontal lobe. "
"I think we study the difference because of the existence of the difference. As mentioned in an earlier module people, scientist in particular, are curious by nature and like new things. It is possible that once scientist discovered how we sense our surroundings that it was only a matter of time before they started questioning why and how we interpret information obtained from the senses. I also believe that our reactions to our perceptions is a major driving force into why we study the difference between sensation and perception. For example our eyes contain specialized cells that contribute to the sensing and ultimately the perception of color but for some reason under the right circumstances in which the appearance of a rainbow is a possibility and is in fact apparent it has a tendency to grab our attention. Our perception of the colors of the spectrum in that context causes a reaction and I think it is because of that reaction is why we study the difference."
"I think we study the difference between sensation and perception because so we can establish how we process things and make sense of what it is. Sensation is things coming into our brain. Perception is how we perceive things, what do we make of the things that we are receiving in sensation. For instance us seeing the visual outside world through our eyes. It starts with our eyes on how we perceive things. Our cornea helps and gather direct incoming light, the iris is the muscle that controls the size of the pupil which the pupil can change in size to let different amounts of light in. The lens part of our eye then bends the light as it enters our eye and then the retina is the sensory receptors part that contains rods which is in charge of our night vision and peripheral vision. Also the cones are part of the retina which processes color, and sharpness. The fovea has only cones which is in control of the sharpness of vision. The optic never is the thick long nerve on the back of our eye which carries then to the visual cortex and our brain and therefore we can perceive things. Also something I think is important part of our perceptual systems is bottom up processing which reacts when we receive sensory information and top down processing this is controlled by context information. Without our eyes sensation and perception would be a hard thing to process. If we saw a potential car accident about to happen we could react by slowing down before driving up into."
"I would describe attention is how we focus on something versus another. This goes hand in hand with change blindness because change blindness is where we miss something that we are looking at. This shows that visually we are not giving it our full attention. Endogenous/controlled attention is the attention you have control over. For example, if you want to give something your undivided attention or not. Posner's cueing paradigm is like a visual form of research to see whether we use endogenous vs. exogenous attention when visual cues appear or move. "
"I would describe embodied cognition as something when we just think about a certain task and it mimics the same brain activity as if we were actually doing the task. I think a good example of this is when we did the experiment with the three different sized boxes. We activated the same brain activity by imagining ourselves tapping the line then the middle of the box as we did when we actually used a utensil to touch those places."
"I would not want to break my frontal lobe. The frontal lobe has so much going on in it, that if I was to damage it, I would not even be myself anymore. The prefrontal cortex controls abstract thinking and judgment, and I consider myself a very level headed person in making decision. I'm ""right brained"", a planner, kind of OCD. I love to learn and problem solve and teach. I wouldn't be able to do any of those things if that area was broken. I am also a very active person. I run and work out, my major is Kinesiology which is the study of movement. I want to be a Physical Therapist which is all about movement as medicine. If my primary motor cortex, the posterior part of the frontal lobe, was broken then I would not be able to do any of the things that basically my whole life revolves around right now because it controls motor movement. In addition, I'm a talker. I've mentioned how I love to teach and learn, and I am also a people person. I love to take care of people which is why I work at the hospital. If my Broca's area was broken (the left side of the frontal lobe), then I would not be able to effectively communicate what I want to say, even though I could understand what was being said to me. That would be extremely frustrating for me, and very disheartening. "
"I would say the worst lobe to break would be your frontal lobe because this lobe controls who you are as person or your personality. It also controls your speech production and attention. So not only could you end up acting like a completely different person you would also struggle communicating with others and paying attention even during simple tasks. This would make it difficult to hold down a steady job or even strong relationships with other people. "
"I would think the parietal lobe would be the worst lobe to break. If I was put my hand on a hot burner I would not be able to interpret the sensory information being sent to move my hand and would burn my hand. I must be able to interpret input sensory information so I can protect my body."
"If we go to cognitivepsychology.wikidot.com/cognition:topdown we will notice a feature to the far right of the web page that asks a question that may produce interesting answers. In a box that contains six symbols and under those symbols there is a caption which asks what do you see. If we chose to answer the question our brain will use both top down processing and bottom-up processing in order to come up with an answer. Word superiority is a phenomenon in which a letter is seen better in a word than on its own when exhibited through top-down processing, which is processing by taking a larger object and moving on to a detailed description and is conceptually driven. Basically, we believe that the symbols in the box read THE CAT and because we have seen the word the cat in one shape or another and in one context or another and have been taught to believe that our interpretation is correct we perceive the symbols as reading THE CAT when in reality the symbols are ambiguous in nature. According to the feature-matching theory which is similar to word superiority but unlike word superiority is attributed to bottom-up processing, which is attending to small details until we have a larger, more solid representation, we break down visual patterns into critical features. In another words we see a series of lines arranged in a familiar pattern that we learned represents a letter which when combined with other letters form words."
"Illusions are a pretty cool topic.  It is a mislead perception.  These mislead perceptions are actually very helpful to scientists in studying the processes of perception.  There are different types of illusions but I have always thought that depth illusions were very interesting.  This is tricking someone's visual perceptual process but playing around with depth cues.  For example, if you have ever walked into a room tat had a painting on the ground that made it look like you were going to fall down a hole in the ground that is an example of a depth illusion.  "
"In any area of psychology you study, you will undoubtedly find experiments of some kind.  An experiment is a way of looking at and measuring a relationship between variables that causes some effect.  Often for this to occur the variables need to be manipulated.  This is no different for cognitive psychology.  Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind, which can make performing experiments more difficult since it is hard to objectively measure thinking.  Just as it is difficult to measure thinking, it is difficult to determine whether the mind and the brain are separate.  The mind-brain connection gives different levels of analysis: physiological and mental, as well as an information processing approach that allows for cognitive psychologist to try and make more sense of thinking.  This information processing approach is also easily applied or transposed onto computers and artificial intelligence.  Artificial intelligence is the use of a computer to try and simulate the mind of a human.  This can be seen in programs like Cortana and Siri.  Artificial intelligence can be used as a model of the human mind to better describe how it works.      "
"In cognitive psychology, studying the behavior of individuals can provide insight on how the mind functions by direct observation. Behavioral brain research is focused on things like how long it takes for people respond, accuracy of answers, and the judgments people make. They take this observable data and use it to make inferences about what is happening with the brain when people perform these processes. One type of behavioral brain research is when a point scale is used to measure people’s judgements about something. For example, towards the end of a college course students are often given a point scale to rate how effective the teaching methods were (although there is a problem with honesty when these scales are used)."
"In my opinion I think the Frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to break. I say this because the cortexes located in this lobe are very important to functionality although the entire brain is but these cortexes specifically. The first important cortex in this lobe is the Primary Motor cortex which is responsible for muscle movement and this is where the motor neurons are that is important to everyday life. The other Cortex located in this lobe is the prefrontal cortex responsible for decision making also known as abstract thinking. This cortex helps focus as well as control systems dealing with attention. Lastly the Broca’s are located in this lobe as well and this is the part where response processing happens and Speech Production in response to others. All of the lobes are vital but in my opinion this lobe has the most variety of functions so if it were damaged a lot of functioning would be disrupted with a person who has damage to it. You wouldn’t be able to respond to other, muscle functions would be inhibited, and you wouldn’t be able to make well thought out decisions."
"In my opinion the frontal lobe would be the worst one to break. The frontal lobe would be the worst one to break because it is the part of the brain that basically controls emotions, problem solving, memory, langauge (speech), judgment, and sexual behavior. If someone was to damage the frontal lobe it could lead to permanent damage. There isn't a cure for the damage done to the frontal lobe.Say for instance someone gets into a car accident and they damaged their frontal lobe, it's a possibility that person lost the ability of their cognitive skills which is the part of the brain that is most important."
"In my opinion the most important lobe that we have is the frontal lobe and here is why. The frontal lobe is important for all key major motor activity/skills in your body. Motor skills would be the most important feature of the frontal lobe for me but that is not the only function that the frontal lobe has. The frontal lobe also controls skills such as behavior, personality, speech, and attention. Breaking other lobes may be responsible for such features as hearing or seeing, but if you were to break the frontal lobe you would find yourself in a vegetable like state and not be able to control any parts of your body, or have a personality. "
"In my opinion the parietal lobes would be the worst to damage or break. I believe this because the parietal lobes are home of the sensory cortex. The sensory cortex is responsible for our feeling of touch and sensation from our body, both good and bad. If it is broken, then we could not feel pain or pleasure, thus giving us zero indication if we are being harmed. For example, if someone could not feel pain then he or she might experience severe burns on an area they may not notice and could lead to a life threatening infection or other life threatening type situation. "
"In my opinion the temporal lobes would be the worst to break. The temporal lobes are important for many different things. It is important with the comprehension of language because the temporal lobe holds the Wernicke's area. It is also where you store new information. If you broke the temporal lobe, it would affect your day-to-day life."
"In my opinion the the Temporal lobe would be the worst one to break. The temporal lobe helps to keep visual memories, and it also helps with hearing input, and the main reason would be because of the Wernicke's area is on the left temporal lobe and this helps with language comprehending. I would not want to loose my visual memories because what if I loose my ability to speak, I could replay these memories over and over in my head. "
"In my opinion the worst lobe to break is the frontal lobe. This is largely due to the fact that a great deal functioning happens in the brain. The frontal lobe handles the motor cortex, which involves voluntary movements. If the frontal lobe was damaged not being able to or having difficulty with voluntary movement is something I would not want to deal with. The frontal lobe is also in charge of abstract thinking, and the ability to think for one-self. When the frontal lobe is damaged research also shows, that it causes a change in personality, and the ability to express emotions. In all there are a variety of reasons as to why this would be the worst lobe to break, because the person mentally as a hole can ""Change"". My personality is something that is unique to me, its how I've made friends, and met people who love me. These are the reasons as to why I would not want to break my frontal lobe. "
"In my opinion the worst lobe to break would be the temporal lobe this would be bad in my opinion because you for one wouldnt be able to truly processes what people are saying to you and you also could loss the ability to recognize faces, then on top of all that it protects the hippocampus."
"In my opinion, I believe the frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to injure. This part of the brain is a major contributor to motor control. Being active and able to take care of myself would be my major desire. This area will leave me with the ability to control my motor functions and respond to people. I may not be able to understand what they are saying, since that is the temporal lobe, but I will be able to say what I am trying to say. When this area is damaged it alters the person the most. If anything is kept from an accident I would like it to be my personality, and how I act now. This is due to the fact that many people are totally different after the frontal lobe is broken. This can push away their family and friends, which I would need to rely on at that time. "
"In my opinion, I believe we studied the difference between sensation and perception because often times people just group them together as one. I feel like people say I just sense this or that, but in reality what they mean is they are perceiving one thing or another. I think an example of this would be when someone says ""I am sensing some tension in the room."" When really, what they mean is they are perceiving that there is some tension in the room because you cannot physically feel (sense) the intangible said tension in the room."
"In my opinion, I feel that the Frontal lobe would be the worst one to break. There are a number of reasons why this would be the worst one, but one major reason would be the loss of the Primary Motor Cortex. The Primary Motor Cortex is the area towards the mid-front of the brain that controls muscle movements in the body. If this were to be damaged, for example, driving down the road may be extremely dangerous due to the inability to control muscle movements. In addition to this, if the Prefrontal Cortex were to be damaged, this would decrease or eliminate amounts of attention, and loose the function of focus and abstract thinking. Both of these areas of the brain are very crucial to a ""normal"" lifestyle. The third area of the Frontal lobe that makes it one of the worst lobes to break is the Broca's area. This entire area of the brain is completely tied to the question of, ""What do I say back to someone as they are talking to me?"". If this area were to be broken, it would make it extremely difficult to  come up with something to say if someone is talking to you. Without speech production, it would be very hard and frustrating to try to communicate to people when you can't seem to ""spit"" the words out. The Frontal lobe is a very crucial area that would be one of the worst lobes to break in an incident. "
"In my opinion, I think that the frontal lobe would be the worst lobe a person can break. The frontal lobe helps control your muscle movements and is where your attention and judgement is controlled. Your Broca's area is located in your prefrontal cortex and is responsible for speech production. I think it would make life very difficult if any of these functions were impaired. I would have trouble concentrating and may become impulsive or have bad judgement. Not being able to move my hands to pick up anything I need would mean I would need someone to help me do everyday things like getting dressed and that is not ideal for me."
"In my opinion, I think the frontal lobe would be horrible to ""break."" This lobe of your brain controls how we think and feel, so if we ""broke"" this portion of our brain we would no longer think or feel how we once did. We would no longer be who we originally were in the beginning. I feel like I would be a completely different person because I would not be able to think of things I would once say and be able to think about certain things the same way."
"In my opinion, I think the worst lobe to break is the parietal lobe. I think this would be the worst lobe to break because it is responsible for long term memory, spatial reasoning and sensation processing. The loss of long term memory would be the most detrimental in my opinion. This is because short term memory is great for storing small amounts of information, but it is easily overwhelmed. I would never be able to form connections from previously learned lessons and have difficulty recognizing objects I encountered after the injury. The ability to process sensation would be equally as troubling. Sensation is responsible for the input that used to produce perception. The loss of processing sensation would cause disruptions in the interpretation of the environment. Finally, the loss of spatial reasoning would lead us to miscalculate our interaction with our surrounding environment. This would lead to difficulty performing the simplest of task necessary for survival."
"In my opinion, I would think the frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to break. I feel that the worst part of breaking that lobe would be the loss of Broca's Area and being unable to communicate successfully with the outside world. Essentially, you would be stuck in your own mind. Furthermore, you would lose your ability for abstract thought  and attention with the damage to the prefrontal cortex, thus leaving you with the comprehension of a child. Finally, your primary motor cortex would be lost causing a lack of muscle movement and potentially leaving you paralyzed, which for me would be one of the hardest things to cope with. `"
"In my opinion, the frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to break. The frontal lobe controls motor skills and produces speech. The Broca's area of the brain is located in the frontal lobe and is in charge of speech production. Therefore, the frontal lobe assists us with movement and speaking, which are important for regular daily activities. For example, I would not be able to walk to class, ride a bike, or type on my computer without the frontal lobe. "
"In my opinion, the frontal lobe would be the worst one to break. I feel like we rely more on our frontal lobes than we do on our other lobes. Damage to the frontal lobe could cause changes in one's personality, paralysis, difficulty with problem solving, memory loss, lack of motivation, and so on. I think it would be bad because it would be the most life changing and difficult to rehabilitate. One example would be the inability to complete every day tasks. Something like making a sandwich can become extremely complex to one with a frontal lobe injury. Also, changes to the personality can come from damage to this lobe. One of my good friends has a girlfriend who experienced frontal lobe damage. He talks about how sometimes she forgets what something simple is, like a banana. He also said she's almost like a completely different person when it comes to personality. "
"In my opinion, the frontal lobe would be the worst one to break. The frontal lobe controls abstract thinking and voluntary movement of the individual. The frontal lobe helps with moving the body, decision-making, and remembering emotional-driven memories. The occipital lobe and the temporal lobe deal with vision and hearing respectively, which is somethings that people already live without or have difficulty with. I think having difficulty with doing everyday basic movements, such as walking, and not being able to determine right from wrong would be very difficult to live without."
"In my opinion, the frontal lobe would be the worst one to break. This lobe controls the basis of your muscle movements in the primary motor cortex, and losing your basic motor functioning would be one of the most awful things in my opinion. It also controls your attention based thinking and abstract thoughts. I feel like if I were to break this lobe I would almost function as though I was a little kid in my thoughts. This is the last of your lobes of your brain to fully develop which explains why children do not understand a lot of complex concepts that older adults do. Lastly, this area contains Broca's area which is responsible for how you form what you say in response to what you hear. I think it would be awful to lose this ability because you could not really relate to people well during conversation, which is a very important part of life."
"In my opinion, the frontal lobe would be the worst to break. This lobe is comprised of the primary motor cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and Broca’s area. While it would certainly be bad to have damaged motor functioning and a lack of speech production, I feel that it would be worst to have a broken prefrontal cortex (PFC). It is partly because of this area that humans can be cognitively distinguished from other mammals and organisms. Our ability to use memories and emotions to make logical decisions, plan for the future, use reasoning, and have distinct personalities really sets us apart from more primitive species. All of this together helps to explain how amazing humans are at abstract thinking, which requires logic, reasoning, and an advanced memory system. I can’t imagine how unfulfilling my life would be if I lost all the abilities given to me by having a fully functioning PFC. For instance, when I came to SOAR at Missouri State and had to make decisions related to my future I relied a lot on my prefrontal cortex. Choosing which classes to register for caused my PFC to get quite the workout. I used memories of the classes I took in high school to predict which ones I would enjoy in college; I evaluated the emotions that were evoked while thinking about potential courses; and I used abstract thinking and the knowledge I had of my personality to know if what I was doing truly represented me as the unique person I am. Without a prefrontal cortex, I would’ve been completely lost and likely apathetic with anything related to planning my future. Because of this, I personally would be most devastated to break my frontal lobe."
"In my opinion, the frontal lobes is the worst one to damage as it provides a variety of functions that are essential to living. The frontal lobe contains the primary motor cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and well as the Broca's area. Here in the brain we are provided with functions that help us know what is going on and what to do in our environment such as abstract thinking, attention, and speech production. Without this appropriate communication is nearly impossible. This lobe deals with a great deal of behavioral and emotional functions that if damaged can cause outbursts that would affect normal behavior. The frontal lobe could be considered the part of the brain that controls the body and everything involved with cognition. This could essentially, if damaged, change a person completely in regards to personality and ability to function at an appropriate level."
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break is the parietal lobe. It would be the worst because it would, depending upon what actually got broken, disrupt your somatosensory area, spatial processing, and long term memory management. With the somatosensory area getting disrupted, you may not notice things you should on your body or you could be feeling pain that isn’t really being caused by something on your body. A disruption in the motor cortex would be problematic as well. All of these possible issues combined work together to create what I think would be the worst circumstances to live with."
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break or damage would be the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe controls cognitive activity and voluntary movement. To me, this would be the worst lobe of the brain to damage because I believe cognitive activity is crucial to living life. It is often said to be the control panel for the brain. It impacts our language, problem solving ability, memory, and judgement. If you damaged your frontal lobe, you would damage a very important center in your brain. You may not be able to mentally function the same. You would lose your ability to make decisions, communicate, solve problems, and judge situations. All of these things are so important to a person's personality and livelihood. Although I would not want to damage any part of my brain, I especially would not want to harm my frontal lobe.  "
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe houses the two portions of the brain that allow me to think of and understand words and to also use my tongue, teeth and lips to form those words. If I can speak, I am still able to communicate somewhat effectively. The frontal lobe also houses the motor cortex, which allows me to direct my muscles to move my body. If I can still move, I am still able to be somewhat independent. While the loss of sight, hearing and taste would be indescribably difficult, I feel that the ability to move and speak outranks those senses. I would still stand a ""fighting chance"" in a life or death situation if I could move, while I might not be able to survive in a world where I could not move. In another example, I might know by sight which berries I should pick so that I can sustain my body, if I am unable to move to the bush and then use my fingers to pick those berries, what good does that visual cue do me? Similarly, I might know that I should move when I hear a train whistle approaching, but if I am unable to move to get out of the way or even to speak to ask someone else with a functioning frontal lobe to help, what good does that knowledge do me? And again, I might know that when I smell something rancid, I should not eat it, but if I am unable to even use my mouth to chew and swallow, why even bother to know that I should not eat that nasty thing? "
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for making our muscles move so we can do activities or even pick up a coffee mug. The frontal lobe also contains the pre-frontal cortex which controls the tension in how we want to th focus over thinking and judgement. Broca's is also in the frontal lobe which is how we respond to people. Without a frontal lobe I would not be able to move, think, or respond to people which would make it very difficult to play basketball or have a conversation."
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. This lobe is responsible for many things including controlling movements, producing speech, paying attention, and abstract thinking. Losing this part of our brain would be the worst because we wouldn't be able to move, speak, or think. "
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. This would be the worst lobe to break because it controls your movement, abstract thinking, attention, speech production, mental activities, reasoning and emotions, personality, planning and reasoning, and managing sequences of behavior. If the frontal lobe broke, I would not be able to walk or talk, i would not be able to perform normal behavioral activities, and I would not be able to control my reasoning and emotions. Also, I would not have the core aspects of my personality. Also, I would not be able to think abstractly. The basic tasks and activities that I would want or need to do daily would be impossible without the frontal lobe."
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the occipital lobe. The occipital lobe is responsible for coordination of eye movements, visual memory, and Image recognition. I think life would extremely hard without these visual functions that we are so used to on an everyday basis."
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the parietal lobe. The parietal lobe is where our primary somatosensory (sensory) cortex, spatial processing, and organization of our memories are all processed, and I believe lacking in any of these factors would seriously hinder the ability to live the life I want to live. Our sensory cortex processes our tactile senses and what we are feeling. If this area were to be damaged, then I would have an extremely hard time with my pain receptors and knowing when to move away from something that is causing me harm. With my spatial processing being broken, I could become confused on where things are in relation to me and I could start running into things or knocking something over on accident because my awareness of my surroundings is off. Lastly, having my memories is a very important part of who I am and knowing who I am. Without being able to recall a memory in its correct order, or even a certain memory at all, would be difficult with a damaged lobe and I could potentially forget who I am."
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the parietal lobe. This lobe controls things like spatial processing, memory management, and is able to tell someone how they're feeling at a particular time as well as anything from taste to balance. If this lobe were broken, one would lose the ability to retrieve and even store memories into long term memory. Anything and everything that you would like to remember would have to continually be practiced in order to keep it in your short term memory. A defective parietal lobe would also interfere with your visual field, causing an individual to be unable to figure out where things are in relation to each other. Moreover, it would affect your attention and consciousness, ultimately affecting other processes pertaining to other areas of the brain. "
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the parietal lobe. This lobe is what helps us make receive sensory information from different parts of our body. When it is damaged people may have a difficult time recognizing that a stove is hot or that ice is cold because your senses would be affected. This lobe is also responsible for spatial reasoning, movement, visual orientation, speech, and information processing. This means that if damaged it could also cause people to have trouble with not really being aware of where their body is positioned in space, it would cause problems with being able to recognize people and objects, and also make it difficult to read or do mathematics. All of these processes are so integral to functioning in everyday life as an adult that having a broken parietal lobe would be a huge struggle."
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the parietal lobes, if by the term break you mean it in the same sense that you broke your leg and will get function back once the injury is healed.  In this circumstance, I believe that he parietal lobe would be the worst because it houses memory and storage, which once that area is injured and the memories are lost you cannot regain them in the same way you originally experienced them.  Eventually, you would be able to regain the features and abilities that are performed by other lobes like muscle movement in the frontal lobes and speech comprehension in the temporal lobes.  Most elements of the brain, if ‘broken’, could eventually, with enough rehab and persistence, be brought back into function, but once memories are gone they cannot be regained outside of someone recounting the experience to you.     "
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would the temporal lobe. Thats because this is the part of the brain where all of your memory and face recognition is stored. Even though loosing any part of my brain would be very traumatic for me, I think this would be the worst one, because I would be scared to wake up and not remember anyone or anything. Loosing special memories and experiences with people who I love would be the most devastating thing I could imagine. I think it would be hard for me to trust anyone, because I would no longer have any personal memories of anyone. How would I know if these strangers have my best interest at heart? The movie Overboard, is a funnier take of a situation similar to this. A beautiful and rich heiress is very cruel to a poor carpenter. She ends up falling overboard on her fathers ship, and gets amnesia. The carpenter is the first one who finds her, and is looking for revenge so he decides to trick her into think that she is his wife- making her clean and cook for him. If I woke up and didn't know anyone around me, how would I know that didn't happen to me! "
"In my opinion, the worst lobe to damage in my brain would be the parietal lobes, with the frontal lobe coming as a close second.  I chose the parietal lobes because somatosensory function is extremely important to me.  Being able to feel when things come into contact with me physically is important, whether it be a bug crawling on my skin or a hot surface I shouldn't touch, I want to know and feel that.  Although I often take this function for granted, I couldn't imagine living without the feeling of physical contact through the stimulation of my muscles and joints.  My parietal lobes also allow me to store long term memories and retrieve them later, which in turn helps me to be a better student.  Without my parietal lobe, I would not be able to store or retrieve long-term memories, which would be extremely upsetting. "
"In my opinion, the worst lobes to break would be the temporal lobes. Without the temporal lobes, one is unable to hear. I cannot imagine never hearing the sound of my husband's or daughter's voice ever again. Also, music is a highly important part of my life and without it I would be very unhappy. The temporal lobes are responsible for understanding speech through the Wernicke's area. I would not want to be unable to understand things that were said to me for the rest of my life. Possibly the worst thing to lose though would be the ability to store new memories. The temporal lobes are connected to the hippocampus and without them I would never be able to create new memories. "
"In my personal opinion the worst lobe to break would be the frontal lobe. I am very into giving my opinion and I love talking to people and the thought of not being able to communicate anything at all to people using words and my voice and would be terrible. I also think losing memories and things like that would be awful but I think I would rather have someone there to talk with me through it all. Not being able to communicate I think would ultimately be too frustrating for me. "
"In one illusion, there was a dragon that seemed to move its head in order to follow the person around the room. Our previous experiences tell us how an object should appear when we move around a room but the dragon goes against what our brains tell us it should be doing. This is because we are interpreting the shape of the dragon heads incorrectly. Using our visual perception and depth cues, we assume that the dragon’s face is coming towards us but really it is hollow. Therefore, the different depth cues our visual system was prioritizing in this instance were not working correctly."
"In order to know how illusions work, we must first define them. An illusion is a faulty or misconception of a perception. One illusion that I thought was really interesting was the color illusion with the American flag. In this illusion, the black, green, and yellow color receptors are being activated and distressed while starring at the white dot in the center of the image. When the images go away, the off-on neurons in the brain are activated and see a form of ""after effect"" of color that is the opposite of the colors previously seen. The colors that do appear are the red, white, and blue colors of the American flag. "
"In order to understand where cognitive psychology began, we need to understand the deeper meaning of it. Cognitive distinctly means thinking, and the psychology end of it means learning how people think. This relates back to how the neurons and mind all connect together, forming a cognitive mind. Psychology, in general, was originally a form of philosophy, led by the well known Descartes, and Locke just to name a few. The true 'father' of cognitive psychology is the famous William Wundt. While producing extraordinary research, he also lead one of the very first psychology laboratory's that had more of a modern touch to it in the 1800's. Over the years, cognitive science research continued. In the 1950's, the research advanced with the use of computers used as a tool to help scientists  better understand cognition. This is where artificial intelligence began to come into the picture. There are a few reasons why cognitive psychology started being researched, and that was because of the questions that Wundt and his team of students began to ask. One question they wanted (and did) find an answer to was that mental activity is not just one large complicated operation, but that it can be broken down into more elemental operations in different places. Wundt also developed an amount of different methods for estimating mental activity. "
"In school you hear the teachers say all the time “pay attention”, and it means to maintain an alert state for a period of time. You can also use the word attention for different meanings such as expressing effort. Change blindness is when you’re not paying attention, and you miss changes happening right in front of your eyes. This happens due to the top down changing what our interest is for the bottom up information comes in clearer. For example, when they talked about asking a question after the video it made me concentrate more on what they were saying instead of the changes happening around them. Endogenous attention also works with a top down goal, and is a voluntary type of attention that happens within you. Controlled attention is called exogenous attention, and it uses bottom up goals which is more of a controlled step by step process. They use Posner’s cueing paradigm to track people’s ability to notice new targets in their line of sight. People that suffer from brain damage would not be able to accomplish this successfully. If your healthy with no problems you would be able to see the new targets in your line of sight and complete the experiment.  "
"In the brain, top down processing, and bottom up processing continuously interact with each other. Bottom up processing detect the characteristics of sensory stimuli such as color, motion,and shapes. That information is processed and our brains begin to consciously and unconsciously recognize differences between groupings. Top down processing focuses on knowledge, beliefs, and expectations to guide perceptual exploration. Perceptual processes in the brain throw away redundant or repeating information , in order to more closely focus on input from essential features to help better decipher missing information from stored information about how things usually and are expected to look like at that point in time. Research has proved that top down processing as well as bottom up processing can influence our perceptions of different parts or objects. For example, we did a recent experiment on word superiority. The context of surrounding letters or shapes can manipulate the perception of a target letter. In past behavioral studies, participants were better identifying a target letter is it was presented in a word before rather than in isolation. Feature matching models take important or discriminating features from the image presented and match these known features of the object. In most circumstances, recognition does not require that the whole object be specified, just the important or discriminating features. All of these are processes of the cognitive brain to decipher and distinguish important or redundant information. "
"In the color illusion of the American flag we discussed in class it showed us how our eyes reverse the colors in afterimages. I stared at the white dot in the middle of the flag with green and black stripes and black stars with a yellow back ground for a short time. As I looked away onto a blank white space I saw the image of a real red, white, and blue flag. This happens because when we stare at the bright colors there is a weakness in our retinal process, and as we look away to the white space our brain will continue to see the true colors until the retinal process fades out.  Our brain remembers what we are supposed to see so after seeing the bright colors our brain fills in the blanks."
"In the early 1950's scientist got tired of studying behaviorist approach and wanted to study more on the processes of the human mind and how it played a role in our lives other than just behaviors. It started being researched because of this want to understand how we functioned because of our brains. It was also of much importance after we had created the first computer. We had noticed a comparison of how a computer functioned and how our brains functioned and we wanted to understand exactly how that process worked. "
"In the frontal lobe is Broca's area. It is where speech production happens. If it is broken, it is called a Broca's Aphasia. The Mexican Wave is an electro-chemical process called the action potential. A neurotransmitter activates a neuron. The message gets sent down an axon. It is sort of like a group of people doing the wave. Myelating it makes it much quicker than if there is no myelination. In Broca's area, it is asking, ""What am I trying to say?"" The process of ""The Mexican Wave"" is what goes to Broca's area to get what you're trying to say out."
"In the rubber hand illusion we watched a video of people who were trying to be tricked into thinking that a rubber hand was their own. The perceptual process of perception is what is being broken down in this illusion because by the end of the experiment for each person, they begin to perceive that the rubber hand is their own rather than their own hand. The sensations that each person experienced with the paint brushes led them to perceive that the rubber hand was their own. "
"Initially, cognitive psychology didn't take off because of its reliability on introspection and its inability to measure mental active, so behaviorism began to gain popularity due to its ability to be measured. However, behaviorism failed to explain perception and measure the activity of the mind and brain, in turn, causing cognitive psychology to gain popularity. Another contributing factor to what sparked cognitive psychology was computer systems (particularly the MIT symposium), which was effectively used to describe cognition. By using computer systems instead of introspection, it allowed for cognitive processes to be measured from an objectively rather than a subjectively, thus being able to eliminate social desirability bias and any other errors to acquire accurate data. Cognition research continued to expand as the military used cognitive testing to evaluate their men on what tasks they are good at and to determine where they should be placed within the military. Lastly, one of the turning points that steered people away from behaviorism and towards cognition was Miller’s Magic Number, which was a collection of research on memory."
"It is good to understand the difference between perception and sensation because to have a good grasp on how the brain works, you must understand that many factors are involved in what we see and our understanding of it. Sensation, or the raw input of data from our visual field into our system, is only the beginning of what we experience. We take the sensations we glean from the outside world, and then our thoughts, experiences, memories, and other factors help us form an interpretation of that sense, or a perception. It is the perception of the input that we experience when we look at, touch, or smell stimuli from the outside world."
"It is important to study the difference between sensation and perception. Both are important to psychology and important compents to understand indivually before diving into how they play a role together. Because they go hand in hand without sensations, perception would be obsolete and without perception we wouldn't be able to interpret sensations. So before learning about both of them together we must learn how they work indivually to fully grasp how they work together. They also are two completely different processes. "
"It is the idea that the environment can affect our brains and our cognition. So it is not just that our brain can affect our body, but our body can affect our brain and our thought processes as well. "
"It is widely believed that cognitive psychology started in 1879 in the first modern psychology laboratory, by Wilhelm Wundt. Why did Wundt and his colleagues begin researching human cognition? As a scientist he probably felt a sense of obligation to explore aspects of his respective field that at that point have not been explored. It may have been because he was experiencing a case of professional curiosity."
"It's important to study and understand the differences between sensation and perception. The terms do not mean the same thing. Sensations are what we sense or experience, such as what we see, taste, touch, smell, and hear. Perception is how our brain interprets these sensations and processes these sensations into something that we can comprehend and explain. By studying these terms, we have the ability to learn more about why our brains perceive sensations in the way that they do, which is sometimes incorrectly. When we misinterpret something, we have the ability to try to explore why this is and where our brains went wrong with interpreting the sensations. "
"Sensation and perception differ in that we can get different perceptions from the same sensation. In other words, sensation varies between having a lot of information or a little information that essentially explains our perception. For example, hearing music doesn’t necessarily mean that you will perceive that music is playing, or just seeing a light doesn’t necessarily mean that you can perceive the actual color of the light. "
"killian_o 1. The Mexican Wave is pneumonic way to understand the internal neuron connections. In order to send a message within the neuron, it must make a few stops along the way. It goes through the dendrites, down the axon, and through the terminal buttons. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that send messages throughout our brain and body and tell the next cell what to do. They communicate signals between the nerve cells, or neurons. The brain uses neurotransmitters for things such as telling your heart to beat. Types of transmitters include serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, endorphins, and hormones. The Frontal Lobe is responsible for the more complicated mental processes such as thinking, decision-making, and planning. Broca’s area is a section of the cerebral cortex and is in charge of the production of speech. All of these things deal our brain our important to how our brain processes information. The Mexican Wave and neurotransmitters work to send important information to our brain. This includes the frontal lobe dealing with higher mental processes, and Broca’s area, which handles speech production. We cannot carry out these processes without the help of the things responsible for sending them. "
"Cognitive Psychology started out of a reaction to behaviorism. Behaviorism was limited in how certain human behavior could be explained. This lead to the birth of cognitive science in 1957 at the MIT symposium. The creation of the computer played a large role in the development of cognitive psychology. The computer was essentially used as a model for researchers in terms of mental activity. It helped the researchers to elaborate on the human brain and our internal processes that influence our behavior.  "
"killian_o 2. Attention is the process that either enhances some information or deters other information. When the information is enhanced that particular information can be processed further while the deterred information can be pushed aside. Change blindness is when someone does not detect changes in the physical features of a particular scene. Endogenous attention is a voluntary attentional process, which is top down. Basically, it originates from within and from your own personal knowledge. This, however, can be overridden by exogenous attention, which are prominent and powerful stimuli that can steal your attention and distract you. This is considered bottom-up since it comes from the outside and depends on the stimuli. Posner’s cueing paradigm is a test that is used to measure attention. The task measures a person’s capability to shift their attention. It essentially shows you where to look. People who are cued are quick to name a target, while the people who are misguided take longer. The level of attention we give can effect how much information we end up processing. With change blindness we could fail to detect the change if we’re not really paying attention to it. That also depends on how we process it though. Endogenous attention and exogenous attention is important to this concept since endogenous attention can be overridden. That being said, how the information is processed depends on the stimuli and previous knowledge. "
"Embodied Cognition is a research aspect of cognitive psychology that stressed the role of the environment on the growth of our mental processes.  What doesn’t come naturally must be learned. The type of environment we’re in can have an effect on how we perceive things or process certain things. Take the typing study for example. When given the option, expert typists press combinations that are easier to type. Non-experts didn’t show a preference while the experts preferred the ones that required different finger groups. "
"killian_o 3.  Artificial intelligence is the use of computers to replicate the human mind. Experiments look for connecting relationships between certain things. Experiments consist of independent variables, dependent variables, and extraneous variables. They test theories to see if there is a correlation, which can often lead to more experiments. Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind. It encompasses the mental processes and how they work. This includes attention, language, creativity, thinking, perception, etc. The mind/brain connection is that the mind is emergent from brain processes. The brain has specific functions, but the mind handles the brain’s interpretation. The study of cognitive psychology and the experiments following its creation has created a fair amount of insight into the human brain. This information has given way to the development of a more advanced type artificial intelligence. It is important to remember the relationship between the mind and body though. The two work together allowing is to makes sense of all the information. "
"Route maps are a type of map within cognitive psychology. It is route specific and describes how to get from point A to point B. You use this kind of map in your everyday life. Every time I explain to someone how to get somewhere they’ve never been before, I enlist route maps. I would give specific directions that shouldn’t be deviated from or else the person would get lost. This kind of map is used more for beginners, but we do enlist fairly often. "
"killian_o 4. The word superiority effect demonstrates that people recognize letters presented within words as opposed to secluded letters. Top-down processing states that we recognize certain patterns through the use of relative information. In bottom-up processing our perception begins with the stimulus. It’s data focused and starts with the sensory input. Feature-matching models look for the more simple distinguishing features of an ob¬ject. Their presence will in turn signal a match. In order for a feature-matching model to be a reasonable explanation of how we recognize certain objects, neurons should show discernment to the parts of the input related to those of the model. These terms all have to do with processing and how that effects our perception. The word superiority effect is a form of top-down processing since relies on the use of relevant information. The feature-matching mode however, relies on stimuli, which is more in line with bottom-up processing. "
"In my opinion, the frontal lobe is the worst one to break. The frontal lobe is responsible for carrying out higher mental processes such as decision making. I make countless decisions daily, and that is a luxury that I would not want to give up. If someone asked me what I wanted to eat, or where I wanted to go on vacation I would want to give them an uncomplicated answer that my brain was able to process correctly. If not, I could end up doing things that I might not want to do before, but because of the damage I might not know any better. "
"The two attention brain networks are the posterior and anterior attention networks. The posterior network is located near the parietal and occipital lobes and is involved in visual exploration. The anterior network is in the frontal and temporal lobes. This network deals with the inhibition of a particular response when the focus is on one stimuli over the other. "
"killion Change blindness is a perceptual phenomenon in which the observer fails to notice a change occurring in their field of vision. This commonly can occur when the point of directed focus, or attention, is not given to the subject that is being changed. There are two types of attention; endogenous attention and exogenous attention. Endogenous attention, or controlled attention, comes from the observer. In other words, it is the focus that the observer has controlled and pinpointed on a subject. Exogenous attention is the attention that is the result of a distracting stimuli. During change blindness the observer most likely has used their endogenous attention to focus on what they believe to be the main subject of the picture, however, a distraction has forced the observer to use exogenous attention on the new stimuli. Posner’s cueing paradigm was an experiment where participants where cued to where a stimuli was going to be, cued incorrectly about the upcoming stimuli, or was not cued about the stimuli. Posner found that when cued correctly, the participants could focus their attention quicker on the upcoming stimuli than when they were cued incorrectly. These results led to him coming up with Posner’s cueing paradigm which described the switch between the two systems of attention as consisting of three parts; initial attention given to a subject, the transition step of changing attention to a distracting stimuli, and lastly, reengaging the attention on the new stimuli in order to process what it is. Change blindness occurs because during the time that the observer focused their exogenous attention on the distraction they did not perceive the change that occurred in the subject of their previous endogenous attention. "
"killion Cognitive Psychology is the scientific study of the mental functioning of the mind. With the introduction of computers, cognitive psychology took off. The introduction provided a way of better understanding the workings of the brain and setting the stage for the testing of hypotheses, or conducting experiments, on the brain. Looking at computers, a researcher could see that electrical impulses were used to perform functions similar to the human brain. This lead to the thought that things that a computer could do a human brain can do and vice versa. Artificial Intelligence is a theory in which a computer system can be used to accurately represent the human brain and perform similar functions. Research into artificial intelligence raises the question of the mind-brain connection. The mind-brain connection states that the mind and brain are different levels of analysis that complement each other. This hinders artificial intelligence research because it raises the question if researchers could get close to recreating a brain in a computer, would it be similar to a human’s mind. "
"killion In my opinion, the frontal lobe would be the worst to break. The frontal lobe is comprised of neurons that are in charge of abstract thought, attention, and speech production. This complex combination gives a lot of who we are as a human and individual. In the case of Phineas Gage, a steel rod pierced his skull and greatly damaged the frontal lobe. Though Gage survived the incident others involved in his life said that he was “no longer Gage”. Phineas Gage could still function at a basic level but because of the damage to his frontal lobe he lost who he was. Damage to this lobe can also damage the motor cortex leaving the affected person with little to no voluntary movement. The many consequences of losing the associated functions is the main reason I believe that the frontal lobe is the worst to break. "
"killion More information than our attention can handle is flooded into our brains. Different levels of our brains work to form a filter to limit the amount of information that is entering the brain in order to prevent information overload. This filtering process of sorting out the important information from the excess information causes a bottleneck effect. Information slowly trickles into the brain and the brain works to interpret the incoming data and send its conclusions to the conscious thought centers in order to create perception of the stimuli. "
"killion One cognitive map is a survey map. In this type of map, you are viewing the world in third person and in relation to other objects. An example of this in my life would be my way of remembering where things are while I am driving to them. I can say that if I am on Sunset Street and it crosses over Campbell Street by Mexican Villa, which is down the street from Walgreens, which is up the street from Gem of India that is located on Battlefield Street, then, Sunset must run parallel to Battlefield and at some point I can cut through a side street to get on Battlefield.  "
"killion One of the illusions discussed in class was the color illusion. During this illusion, the observer stared at a color inverted image for a short while and then looked at a blank screen. What the observer saw was an after effect image with the correct colors. In this illusion, the on-off cells were affected. When the image is present, certain on-off cells are activated almost excessively. They eventually tire and when the image goes away the opposite off-on cells are slightly activated. This produces an after effect of the initial image, however, in the reverse color sense due to the switch in the off-on cell being activated due to the absence of the on-off cell activity."
"killion One type of brain research is causal brain research. In this type of research, scientists are able to better map out locations of different functions in the brain. One example of casual brain research is the use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or TMS. TMS is an instrument that allows researchers to activate neurons in different parts on the surface of the brain in order to see what the function is and form a simple map of the brain."
"killion One way of testing attention is to use electrophysiology or ERP. Electrophysiology measures the electrical activity generated by the brain and can detect variations when observing a stimulus. Researchers can not only see when a person has begun focusing on a stimulus but also the moment when they switch from endogenous attention to exogenous attention and vice versa. This way to test attention, however, is not that great at detecting the precise location of the activity. Another way to test attention is the use of functional neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Functional neuroimaging and TMS allows a researcher to temporally activate electrical impulses in a specific area of the brain and witness what functions are affected and use that information to map the individual’s brain without causing damage or requiring surgery. With the use of this technology, researchers could attempt to map out a pathway that attention followed."
"killion Processing in the brain can be separated into two categories; top down processing and bottom up processing. In top down processing previous knowledge, along with the context in which a stimuli is presented, drives the observer to form a perception of a stimuli. This can be seen in word superiority which is the ability of the brain to recognize words even when they are partially covered or the letters in the center of the words are scrambled. In bottom up processing the sensory information coming from the stimuli drives the processing of it. The feature matching theory states that the observer uses features of a stimuli in order to identify it, such as saying an animal needs to have wings and a beak to classify as a bird or that only an edible object with seeds on or inside of it can be identified as a fruit. This theory can also be used when identifying words because the observer is matching the features of the letters to identify possible options for the observed word. "
"killion The brain is separated into 4 lobes that each consist of a left hemisphere and a right hemisphere. The occipital lobe is located in the back of the head, the parietal lobe is located on the sides of the head, the temporal lobe is located towards the front of the head over the ears and in the temple region, and the frontal lobe is located in the front of the head. The frontal lobe is responsible for abilities such as abstract thought and motor actions. Located towards the back of the frontal lobe is Broca’s area which controls things involved in speech production. Behind this region is the motor cortex which receives information from all over the body and sends information to the muscles via neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are small amounts of chemical compounds that flow across a synapse from one terminal button on an axon on a neuron, to the dendrite of another neuron. Neurotransmitters act as postmen delivering the information from one axon to another. Receptors on the dendrite receive the message and, if the message is strong enough, an action potential travels down the dendrite to the cell body in a form similar to the Mexican Wave. Like the popular stadium game, action potentials are moved down the axon of the neuron as sodium-potassium gates open in front of it and close behind it.   "
"koester A cognitive map is a mental representation of a physical location. This happens when it is dark in your house at night and you are still able to walk to the bathroom and back. Our brain allows for this to happen because we have a mental map of where things are located and the path we take to get from one point to another. After repetition, our inds create a mental map."
"koester Cognitive Psychology started in the late 1950s as a reaction to behaviorism. Psychologists felt they need to explain mental processes in regard to behavior. The approach of cognitive psychology was heavily influenced by the computer. Simon, Newell, and Chomsky all had a significant role in the start of this science by comparing the mind to a computer. This idea led to more research in AI and how the mind controls behavior. "
"koester Embodied cognition is the idea that not only is the mind connected to the body, but that the body influences the mind, cognition is influenced by our environment. This was an idea by decartes. An example of this would be laying down to go to sleep. Sleep is a mental function controlled by the brain. However, we lay down at night to sleep. By laying down we are placing our bodies in a position that will assist the mind in sleeping. You would not be able to sleep while jogging, your body is not placed in the right position."
"koester The bottleneck theory is the idea that we can only take in a certain amount of information at one time. Because of this, we process things in a sequence. What comes in first gets processed first and everything after will follow that order. This theory illustrates the fact that performance failures occur because we can only do one thing at a time really well. Mental processing can be explained as exogenous, which is automatic, coming from the outside, and endogenous, controlled and coming from within."
"koester The chimeric faces experiment was a test on brain symmetry. This gave an idea on which hemisphere of our brain was processing images presented in the opposite side of our visual field. The independent variable of this experiment was the faces presented to the group of students. The dependent variable was which side face displayed provoked a more positive or negative emotion. Depending on which face was chosen, you would figure out which side of your brain was responding to that visual field. "
"koester The dragon is an example of the hollow face illusion and depth perception. Our brain has an assumption about the structure and placement of the dragon’s head, but if you move far enough around it, you see that it takes on a different shape. This happens because we see in two dimensions but are surrounded by a three dimension world. Therefore, the eye and brain have to make assumptions about the structure and the orientation of the object."
"koester To me, the frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to break. This houses your motor cortex, which aids in motor function. The frontal lobe also contain brocas which controls speech. The frontal coretx is also responsible for reasoning, emotion control, and spatial orientation, including how you orient yourself to your environment. If you break the frontal lobe, you lose the ability to perform motor functions. You can think about doing them but cannot actually perform them. To me, that is almost like being trapped in your own body. You also damage brocas, and lose the ability to form speech so you cannot communicate what you would like to do if you physically could. "
"koester Two attention networks are the posterior and anterior networks. The posterior network is near the parietal and occiptal lobes and is involved with visual search. This is seen in Posner’s cueing paradigm. This shows that people are quick at naming a target if they are cued in a location but they are slow if they are mis-cued. The Anterior network includes the frontal and temporal lobes. This is when the focus is on one thing at a time and involves inhibition of response. This is dominant in the right hemisphere and occurs when something catches our attention unexpectedly and breaks our attention away from the task we orginially had focused attention on, also known as bottom up processing. "
"koester We study the difference between sensation and perception because they have a complimentary but different role in the we we interpret the world around us. When you have a certain sensation, you make a perception based on that sensation. You can also have a perception of something without experiencing the actualy sensation. That is where they compliment each other but are different. We experience bottom up processing and top down processing. Bottom up processing is propelled by sensory information. You can see this done by things that we group together based on similarity. Top down processing is propelled by the actual context. We see this in action with the word superiority effect. This is the idea that we can read a word that may be mixed up or misspelled and know what it should say because of our expectations. This happens in autocorrect when you text. Sometimes the words get mixed up or changed but the other person recognizes what you were trying to say based on their expectations of how the sentence will read."
"koester When doing brain research, one type is correlational research. When doing this you are looking at two things at once and seeing how they relate without manipulation of any variables. Correlation does not imply causation. There are four dimensions that correlational studies are evaluated on. Spatial, temporal, how invasive it is, and how much it costs. Some examples of these tests include EEG,ERP,and EMG. All of these are electric tests that are great at time, not painful or expensive, but they are terrible at the space aspect. There is also MEG,PET, and MRI. These tests are done by blood. They are great at space but fall somewhere in the middle for time, pain and cost. The last one is optical imaging which uses lasers. This is great at time, space, and has little pain but is very expensive. The downside to correlational research is that it does not tell if there is a positive or negative activation, people are all different and the brain is always active. "
"The frontal lobe is the part of the brain that is in charge of higher/abstract thought. Within this lobe you will find Broca’s Area which is the part of the frontal lobe that controls what we say and other speech production tasks. All of these functions are able to come about due to neurons, which are able to communicate with each other through dopamine that is created also known as neurotransmitters. Outwardly the communication is processed by machines as an electrical process referred to as the Mexican Wave."
"Attention is a term that covers a multitude of theories, but overall refers to one’s capability to pay attention to specific things while ignoring everything else irrelevant. Change Blindness on the other hand refers to the phenomenon where, due to what we are choosing to pay attention to, we may completely miss a change that has occurred within our visual environment.  Another specific kind of attention would be endogenous attention also referred to as controlled attention. This deals with our controlled attention that stems from “top down processing”. The opposite of this would be called exogenous attention. The visual task that shows us the differences between the two types of attention is referred to as Posner Cueing Paradigm. "
"Cognitive Psychology deals with metacognition, or the “thinking mind”. Some cognitive psychologies attempt to uncover where the “mind” and the “brain” connect/intercept. This belief is know as the mind-brain approach.  Through experiments psychologists are able to identify possible “causal relationships” that exist between certain variables. Experiments have also been used in order to determine whether it is possible to create a computer that can pass as a human based on how it performs are certain tests and tasks. However, this phonomena is considered Artificial Intelligence."
"There are 3 main parts for processing. One of he simpler parts of processing is called bottom up processing. The idea is that you are creating a picture of your perceptions from the ground up based upon the input you are getting through your sense in your environment. The more complex form of processing would be top down processing. This type of processing entails using prior knowledge and your own expectations as a way to interpret what you are perceiving. One expectation that we have is the belief that letters will always spell a word; an expectation referred to as Word Superiority. When it comes to categorizing our environment and our perceptions the Feature Matching Theory suggests that every object we perceive has a specific category of features that are necessary in order for us to match it with other information."
"It is important to study the difference between sensation and perception because it is important to be able to make the distinction between interpretation that is influenced by the brain and opinion influenced simply by the senses. Two people may be able to come to the same conclusion, but if one of them has impaired senses that are necessary to receive the sensory information to come to the conclusion, then one would want to know how they can to the conclusion via their perception. It is also important to understand that since sensation is based upon raw sensual data it is possible to receive too much or too little information. Actors/actresses need to know if their faces are not epressive enough because those audience members who are hearing impaired and unable to read lips may not be able to come to the right conclusions of the situtaion based upon what they are seeing."
"One type of brain research would be “mental rotation” research. This type of research studies how our brains rotate visual images. In 1971 Shepard and Metzler conducted a classical experiment where they rotated objects at varying degrees and participants were supposed to be able to decide whether the 2 objects show were the same or different. While they used examples that were both similar and different, they only used the data of the examples that were similar. This way they could focus upon which degress of rotation were easier to recognize and which degrees of rotation made it more difficult for the participant to recognize that both objects were congruent."
"Cognitive Psychology started in Germany with Wilhelm Wundt, and later continued with his student Edward Tichener. What really propelled cognitive psychology, however, was the increasing implementation of Behaviorism practices in Psychology. Once the computer was developed cognitive psychologists were able to use this as a model for reseraching how mental activities take place. Once scientists began to view the brain in terms of computuers it became easier for psychologists to look into how each part of the brain worked and what their functions are"
"The Change Blindness Experiment: participants were asked to watch a film and during the film they were supposed to count how many times a ball was passed between people wearing a specific colored shirt. At the end of the video they were asked if they noticed how many changes happened in the background during the video. There were no groups, just one group (the Summer PSY 422 students). The independent variable would be the “task” participants were given at the beginning of the experiement, and the dependent variable would be the number of changes the participant was able to identify at the end. The average for the group was 1.81 even though there were 8 changes total. This experiment shows how top down processing works, but also show cases the different kinds of attention that there are."
"Ebbinghaus has a popular illusion where you have two sets of images made out of 5 circles. You are supposed to determine which center circle looks bigger but the reality isthat they are both the same size. This illusion shows a break in our bottom up processing because we base our decision off of the circle directly surrounding the center circles which trick us into believing they are different sizes. This would be a case where perhaps we have too much sensory information."
"When I am on my way to work I use “Survey Maps”. It helps me to determine the fastest and most efficient way to get from A to B and can be altered as I am using the map. So if I am started on a specific route but notice that it’s 3p and know that summer school buses are typically common on the main roads, I can recalculate a new route based on this information utilizing the smaller roads that I am aware of near me."
"manthei 1. The mind is an interesting thing: it contains many areas including the Broca’s Area, the frontal lobe, neurons which contain neurotransmitters, and it even has an epic process called the Mexican wave! If you’ve ever wondered how you are able to speak, Broca’s Area controls speech production. The frontal lobe controls abstract thinking which can help you determine how you interpret what other people say. There is an electric process and a chemical process within the brain to further help you communicate with the world around you. The eletric process between neurons is called, “The Mexican Wave” and the chemical process process for the neuron is called “neurotransmitter(s)”. All of these work together, along with other parts of your brain to make sure you can communicate well with whoever is around you. "
"manthei 2. Have you ever wondered why some people are able to focus on one subject really well and others…well are not so great at it? A few terms involved with attention, or lack thereof, include attention, change blindness, controlled attention, and Posner’s Cueing Paradigm. First, we’ll define attention. Attention is basically one’s ability to focus on certain things while not paying any attention to other things (an example would be a student taking a math exam. They will pay attention to numbers, but not the directions as much).  What if the student taking a math exam misses a question by accident? This may be a result of change blindness. Change blindness is missing a small change in your field of vision. Controlled attention is any kind of attention that a person is aware of making while using top-down process, for example, if the student choses to focus on one number within a problem on his math exam, this may be controlled attention. The last term, Posner’s Cueing Paradigm is any visual task that may show the difference between the two types of attention. Posner’s Cueing Paradigm may be used on the student’s math exam if the student uses different types of attention depending on how the problem is presented. "
"manthei 3. Cognitive Psychology is the study of the (human) mind when it is thinking. Cognitive Psychology can include a mind-brain approach which tries to pin-point where exactly the mind and the brain intersect. When Cognitive Psychology first became popular, scientists attempted to use artificial intelligence to help them find answers. Artificial Intelligence is the design of a computting machine to act like the mind of an average human being. Many experiments were done in the field of Cognitive Psychology including the Tuning test, which we did in class. An experiment is looking for casual relationships between variables, but said variables must be changed in some way. "
"manthei 4. Have you ever wondered how and why our brain catagorizes certain things or how our brain decides to prioritize something? Our brain will either use bottom-up processing or top-down processing. Bottom-up processing is basically creating a perception based on the sensory input. Top-Down processing is creating a picture of perception based on background knowledge or expectations. Our brain also uses the feature matching theory, which states that we match things based on a specific set of features required for the object. An example of bottom-up processing could be when a person is reading braille. They are using their sense of touch to create a picture. An example of top-up processing might be when a young child decides a penguin can fly because it’s a bird. The student may also decide a pengion is a bird because it matches certain requirements that birds have (it has wings). A final “mind trick” is word superiority. Word superiority is the way we perceive letters to always spell a word. An example would be if I had spelled, “penguin” as “pengiun.” The reader would still be able to tell what the word was. "
"manthei Cognitive Psychology began to become more popular around the time that the computer was first invented and brought into society, which was the late 1950’s and early 1960’s. Herbert Simon, Alan Newell, and and Noam Chomsky all played a prominent role in explaining how the mind works like a computer. Cognitive Psychology began being researched for three main reasons: Scientists are like cats (they’re curious), scientists like to show off (other research), and scientists like to get paid a lot (applications). "
"manthei Embodied cognition is when the brain’s regions involved in imagining things are the same as actually doing them. An example that was used in our notes is singing to yourself involved using your Brocca’s area which is speech production. My own example would be when you are using your auditory senses to listen more closely to the lyrics of a song rather than just listening to the words and the song. "
"manthei In my opinion, the worst lobe one could possibly damage or break is the temporal lobe. As we’ve discussed in class, the temporal lobe is in charge of all hearing things, face recognition, and memory. I feel this lobe would not be a good idea to damage because memory is incredibly important to our lives. Sure, there are some memories I wish I could forget, but there are also some memories that I would absolutely hate to not have anymore. I would also be very intimdated by people if I could not recognize the faces of the people I love most. I use my listening skills (selectively sometimes) on a daily basis, I think I’d go crazy if I couldn’t hear someone when they were speaking to me. "
"manthei One of the experiments that we’ve talked about in the section of lectures is the movie perception test. The groups involved were the particants who took the experient. The indpendent variable is the changes within the movie scene, like the woman missing her scarf. The dependent variable is the rest of the scene and the consistent characteristics. The results were different depending on what the viewer decided to pay attention to (dialogue/scenery). After seeing the results of the experiment, we learned that the average student only noticed about 1.7 changes out of 7 possible answers. "
"manthei One type of brain research is behaviorism. Behaviorism is more or less a method that directly measures directly obserable behavior like the time it takes to respond. It can include being scored on accuracy, response time, protocols collection, and judgements. An example of this type of research is an IQ quiz that gives the participant a math quiz with a certain time limit. The exam would be scored on accuracy, not on the time completed by. "
"manthei The two attention brain networks are the anterior network and the posterior network . The posterior network is located near the partiel and occipital lobes and is responsible for the visual search. The Anterior Network on the other hand is near the frontal and temporal lobes and is responsible for when focus is on one stimuli instead of another.  It is also involved with inhibition of response. A person may use his or her anterior network when they are looking for an address (they may tune out the radio to look closer for the address). A person may use his or her posterior network may be used when the same person looking for an address only focuses on even numbered houses instead of the odd numbered houses. Both networks are important to maintaining our active listening/attention skills. "
"Mental activity as philosophy began in Germany in the 1870. It started in a lab run by Wilhelm Wunt. In the beginning mental activity fell under behaviorism. Then came the cognitive revolution in the 1950-60's. Behaviorism was seen as not being able to explain all human actions and behaviors. All these studies began because of interest in consciousness and expanded from there. "
"Mental Rotation is a study of how one rotates mental images. An example of this is American Sign Language. People who are fluent in ASL are more able to rotate. They are not always looking at someone headon. Sometimes they are standing to the side of the person signing."
"Messages are transmitted through the brain by a complex process which can be broken down into different steps and thought of as the process of ""the Mexican Wave "" or a tradition that is experienced at many sporting events. When messages need to be transported throughout the brain from neuron to neuron, neurotransmitters, or chemicals such as dopamine and seratonin, are received by the receptors of the neuron which are located in the dendrite ""branches"" of the neuron. This neurotransmitter must then reach an action threshold to be delivered down the axon into the neuron synapse and out to the next nueron. This process is like a wave in that messages are being constantly pushed into and out through the neurons. Groups of these neurons can be categorized as making up different ""lobes"" of the brain each lode has different areas known as ""cortexes"" that are responsible for different tasks and processing of the brain. One of the lopes in the brain is the frontal lobe, among others, which contains the Primary cortex, the Prefrontal cortex, and the Brocas cortex. The Brocas cortex is named after Pierre Paul Broca and is responsible for both speech production and language processing. Some are born with damage or can suffer from damage later in life to this brocas area of the brain. If this happens some symptoms include stuttering or even speech aphasia, there are many kinds of speech aphasia but most entail problems with speech formation and language processing. "
"Mexican wave (wave that people do in stadiums) is a way of visualizing the action potential.  Action potential is the passage of an impulse along the membrane of a muscle or nerve cell.  Neurotransmitter is a chemical that is released at the end of a nerve that causes the transfer of an impulse to another area and controls the communication between cells. Neurons use action potential to transport information and releases neurotransmitters to influence another neuron.  Higher brain functions like learning, behavior, and personality occur in the frontal lobe.  Broca’s area is the area of the brain located in the frontal lobe that determines and controls the types of action potentials required for fine motor movements."
"miller Cognitive psychology is the study of how we think. To study this, researchers perform experiments designed to help them learn more about the brain and the mind- brain connection. There has been much effort put into studying Artificial Intelligence, which is trying to get computers to think on their own. This might be reworded as trying to make computers perform cognition.  "
"miller Correlational neuroimaging. One example is Electroencephalography (EEG) which can be used to track changes in sleep"
"miller Embodied cognition is where your brain uses the same areas for performing an action and imagining the same action. One example is the lab we did where we tapped the boxes then imagined tapping them. It used the same part of our brain."
"miller In Germany, where Wundt focused on understanding consciousness. This eventually led to the birth of cognitive psychology."
"miller In the study of attention, there is much emphasis on Failures of selection, and successes of selection. With the failure of selection occurs change blindness. This is where a person fails to detect changes around them. On the successes of selection is endogenous/controlled attention. The textbook uses an example of searching for someone who was wearing a particular color. As you search for that person, you tend to notice everything with that color. Within you was the knowledge of what the color looked like. So with endogenous/controlled attention, the attention is voluntary and comes from within. When people are cued they can find a target; in other words if they were told where to look. But if the cue was wrong, in other words they were told where to look but the target appeared elsewhere, it went much slower. This experiment is known as Posner’s cueing paradigm."
"miller Positron emission tomography (PET) and fMRI both measure blood flow to certain areas of the brain. This can be used to test which areas of the brain are involved with attention."
"miller The frontal lobe is one of the major areas of the brain that is associated with speech. The same is true of Broca’s area, an area that is crucial to speech. Within those areas as well as the rest of the brain, neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, help send messages from neuron to neuron. These neurotransmitters are chemicals that are produced in the brain and they go between dendrites helping to send messages to each other. When there is not enough of these neurotransmitters mental illness can be the result. Antidepressants and antipsychotics are synthetic drugs that help the brain produce more of these neurotransmitters. So the messages that are sent by an electro-chemical process from one neuron to another and follow a pathway through the axon which is surrounded by the myelin sheath. So the entire process of interneuron communication is referred to as the Mexican wave, also known as action potential."
"miller The Nekker Cube. It demonstrates that we can see both interpretations of the cube but only one at a time. This is due to the ambiguity of the cube and show that perception is interactive. "
"miller The occipital lobe. Because it controls everything about vision and it would not be easy to be blind. "
"miller Top down processing is where our perception is influenced by things we already know, believe, or expect. Bottom up processing is influenced by sensory information from one’s surroundings. Nearly every bit of perception that we get is influenced by both top down and bottom up processing. One example of this is Word superiority. This is when like on those pictures posted on face book the word can start with one letter and end with another but the middle of the word is jumbled. WE can still tell what the word is meant to be because of word superiority. The context makes us perceive the rest of the letters as being a word. Another example is feature matching theory. This is how we can distinguish letters from one another because we are familiar with the features or characteristics of the various letters of the alphabet."
"Most major sporting events take place in a big stadium where thousands of people come to support their favorite home team. Whether it is baseball, football, soccer, or other similar sports. During the game, it is more than likely that you start to people standing up, putting their hands in the air, making a wave motion, returning to their seats, and the people next to them following the same pattern. This is a fun way to get the energy going in the stadium and to show your favorite time that you are excited to be there cheering them on. This activity is called the Mexican Wave. In order to process and understand this movement, your frontal lobe must be working properly. The frontal lobe is an area located in the front of the brain. It handles attention, short-term memory tasks, and motivation. Inside the frontal lobe, there is a small area known as Broca's area. This area is on the dominant hemisphere of the brain and is linked to speech production. As long as this area is functioning properly, it will allow you to scream, shout, and yell things to the crowd while doing the Mexican wave. There is one more thing that you absolutely need in order to make this wave happen, you need your neurostransmitters. Neurotransmitters are a substance that is let loose at the end of a nerve fiber when the nerve receives an impulse. It moves across the synapse which causes the transfer to other nerves, muscle fibers, and other structures. It is known as the messenger between cells. We need these in order to perform the Mexican wave because a signal has to be sent to the frontal lobe to understand the task and for our hands and fingers to perform the movement, signals have to be sent between cells so our fingers and hands will move. It is all a big message process. "
"My favorite type of brain research is brain functioning a learning. This type of brain research focuses on the way our brain is mapped and how it works. It teaches us how we learn and store things, which I think it fascinating. "
"Neurons have two different ways of communicating.  The Mexican Wave, or an action potential, is the way in which neurons communicate through electrical impulses and neurotransmitters are the chemical component to communication.  A common example of a neurotransmitter is dopamine.  While neurons are located throughout the entire body, we commonly think of them being primarily located in the brain.  To better understand how the brain works, it is easier to break it down into parts or lobes.  One of the most commonly known lobes is the frontal lobe which is known for its functions of abstract thinking, attention, and speech production.  The speech production aspect of the frontal lobe is primarily due to the Broca’s area, which is still in the frontal lobe that control what we say in response to the input we are hearing.     "
"Neurons in our body fire in order to send information to the brain. Neurotransmitters are conductors that carry messages to be sent from one neuron to the next on the way to, and within, the brain. Neurotransmitters are released into synapses by axon terminals and are reabsorbed if they are not used. Dendrites then pick up the message and send it down the axon to continue its progression through the nervous system. The Mexican Wave is an interpretative dance that demonstrates the way that messages are sent down an axon and on to another neuron, via an action potential. It uses people to demonstrate action potential propagation down the axon as the person(message) jumps from one spot to the next(message following the myelination). Without myelination, messages are sent much slower. It also uses people and fruit to demonstrate the moving of ions in the neuron so that the neuron can reach its threshold and the action potential can begin. Neurons are abundantly present in our body and we have different types. We have motor neurons, which send signals to our muscles for movement and sensory neurons, which send signals to our brain for interpretation. Muscle movements are controlled by primary motor cortex located in the posterior portion of the frontal lobe of our brain. The frontal lobe is on the anterior aspect of the brain and allows us to move muscles, think abstractly, make judgements about situations, focus attention on things, and think through things.  Within the frontal lobe is Broca’s area. Broca’s area is concerned with speech production and helping us figure out what to say. As we hear something in our environment, our brain processes it and if we are going to respond verbally, Broca’s area is what is responsible for creating that response. People who have broken this area in some way can still receive input from the world, but cannot respond verbally because they cannot access their language stores. (Personal Story!) I met a guy in the hospital who had a stroke that caused him to not be able to access this area and he said it was the strangest thing that he knew what was being said, but had no idea how to say what he wanted to say because nothing made sense that came out. He said that he thought he could text it instead and when he looked at the keyboard, none of the letters made any sense so even though he knew how to text it and had done it thousands of times, the keyboard was confusing. He couldn’t understand why he couldn’t understand! It was crazy to think about!"
"Neuropsychology is the study of the brain and how it causes our behavior and actions. An example of this could be when someone has a tumor in their brain and neuropsychologists study how this tumor in that area of their brain changes and affects their behavior versus when they did not have the tumor. "
"Neurotransmitters - released at the axon tip and sent to a dendrite of another neuron. There are different types(chemicals) in order to send different messages "
"Neurotransmitters are being sent through the brain each and every second. Also known as chemical messengers neurotransmitters transmit information to target receptors and are responsible for shaping every day life and functions. They help link the mind and body. They are responsible for telling you when your hungry, when your tired, and even when to breathe. These messages are passed within the cortexes of the brain. The frontal lobe is generally involved in managing, organizing behaviors, and all mental activities. The frontal lobe also plays a major role in producing speech. The brocas area, located in the frontal lobe is essential for producing speech sounds.Other areas of the frontal lobe control movement which is found in the primary motor cortex. The Mexican Wave started in the Olympics, specifically Mexico where it originated. The wave phenomenon is a crowd controlled mentality. Crowd behavior is when you are more likely to do something in a crowd rather in private. The wave is when dozens of people stand up and sit back down creating a wave effect around the stadium. Neurotransmitters send information to our bodies and brains, also interacting with the frontal lobe and primary motor cortex, and we begin to perform the action in a crowd controlled environment. "
"Neurotransmitters are chemicals that carry information to dendrites along the end of an axon, and when there are enough neurotransmitters to reach the threshold that is required for an action potential to fire, a reaction is produced. In the frontal lobe, which is the area of the brain that is responsible for speech production and comprehension using Broca's area, movement using the primary motor cortex and abstract thinking and attention using the prefrontal cortex, neurotransmitters attempt to produce action potentials that would lead to speech production or to a muscle movement. When enough of these neurotransmitters are produced and sent to a neuron, the Mexican Wave of neurotransmitter movement is produced. This occurs when neurotransmitters reach threshold and more and more calcium ions are sent into the synaptic cleft until threshold is reached and an action potential is produced. For example, before you can speak your name, a sufficient number of neurotransmitters have to travel to the Broca's area in frontal lobe, attach to a neuron and then break through the synaptic cleft to the other side before an action potential can be produced. In this example, the culmination of all of that activity is you speaking your name."
"Neurotransmitters are necessary for our brain to be able to communicate with the rest of our body. These neurotransmitters carry information throughout the body and are released by neurons. They move from the axon of a neuron to the dendrites. The Mexican Wave is considered inter-neuron communication. This is when the dendrites move together and wait for a neurotransmitter to be released. When the neurotransmitter reaches the dendrites, it communicates with them and tells them what to do. The frontal lobe is a very important area of the brain. It is responsible for tasks such as controlling movements, planning, reasoning, speaking, and other tasks. The Broca's area in particular is located within the frontal lobe and it is used for producing speech."
"Neurotransmitters are very important chemical substances.  They are released at the axon terminals and they diffuse across a synapse.  They can cause the beginnings of an impulse or transfer the impulse to another structure.  The transfer of neurotransmitters from neuron to neuron is called an action potential.  An action potential is kind of like the Mexican Wave, which is the wave that most people are a part of at a sporting event.  Just like the action of standing and raising your arms in the stands is passed from person to person, action potentials are transfered from neuron to neuron in the same way.  Action potentials cause impulses to happen.  For example, if an action potential traveled through the neuron and ended up making an impulse in the frontal lobe area then that impulse would most likely produce speech.  This is because the frontal lobe manages sequences or behaviors of mental activities and also produces speech.  The Broca's Area is the main speech production and is associated with the frontal lobe.  If the action potential traveled through the frontal lobe and to the Broca's Area and an impulse was put into action, then speech would be produced.  "
"Neurotransmitters is released from the axon terminal after an action potential has reached the synapse. Neurotransmitters cross the synaptic cleft, moving from axon of one neuron to the dendrites of another. The frontal lobes are generally involved in managing sequences of behaviors or mental activities. The frontal lobes play a major role in producing speech which is the Broca's area is usually identified with the third frontal gryus in the left hemisphere, and this area is crucial for programming speech sounds. The Mexican Wave is mechanisms that enable certain brain cells to persuade others to create The Mexican Wave. These terms fit together because the neurotransmitters can cause the frontal lobe which plays an important role in the Broca's area to do The Mexican Wave."
"Neurotransmitters send nuerons throughout the brain telling the body what is happening and what to do. These are considered vibrations scattering throughout the brain. The frontal lobe is responsible for higher brain processes. These processes include things like speech. Within the frontal love is broca's area. Broca's area is linked to speech development. Within these structures the nuerotransmitters are telling the brain what to do next and what to say. These neurons tell and persaude the transmitters what to do by utilizing vibrations. Neuro scientist have called this the mexican wave. For as though during the mexican wave, each person in a stadium convinces the other to do the wave. With everyone in co-op the wave is succesful and easily influenced by the last section but when the wave is broken we can see it no longer functions properly. This is the same for cognitive functioning and how the neurons share and communcate information. "
"Neurotransmitters: This is the chemical process that neurons use to communicate using dopamine."
"Observing and measuring accuracy is a behavioral type of research. This research measures the accuracy of the participant answers to specific questions. The questions should not be too difficult or easy to answer. An example of this in the real world is some nurses must take a pre-employment test to see if they can answer general questions related to their job. They must attain a certain level of accuracy to be hired."
"One area of brain research is correlational research. This area of research involves having a subject do something and look at the area of the brain that is activated. An example of this type of research would be the study of electrical activity in someones brain. AKA an EEG/ERP/EMP. These tests are not very painful or expensive and they are also very good on time. However these tests are not as accurate on how close they come to localizing the area of the brain that produces the signal. "
"One example of a type of brain research is correlational research. In this type of research, researchers attempt to localize or narrow down what part of the brain is involved in specific activities or behaviors; however, one major issue with this type of research is that scientists are unable to prove theories or that certain locations in the brain are involved. This type of research is unable to prove causation. While we are able to see a pattern of how information is processed, we are unable to say that this neuron firing or this specific area carrying out x always leads to y. The quality of correlational research is graded using four criteria: spatial resolution, which is how accurately or how well the research is able to narrow down a specific area of the brain involved, temporal resolution, which is how accurately alterations in brain activity are measured, invasiveness, which tells us how many or how much alien material or substances were introduced into the normally isolated environment of the brain, and cost, which tells us how much the experiment cost for equipment usage and how much they were required to pay each experiment subject. Electroencephalograms allow researchers to track brain activity by attaching monitors to a subject's skull. Then the subject is introduced to stimuli, and the monitors then track the areas of the brain that ""light up."" A potential confounding point of this research, however, is its lack of ability to narrow down which portion of the brain is active (in other words, it has poor spatial resolution). On the other hand, this type of research is not costly, is not at all invasive, and has excellent temporal resolution.   "
"One example of an illusion studied in class is the tilt aftereffect illusion. The tilt aftereffect illusion demonstrated the fatigue of the edge detector on-off off-on cells. The edge detector cells are responsible for processing edges in our visual field. The cells are paired in groups that consist of positive and negative cells. The positive cells will respond to one set of attributes and the negative cells will respond to the opposite.  What happened in this experiment was the group of positive on-off, off-on cells interpreting the angled lines became fatigued and the reverse edge detector on-off, off-on cells compensated for positive cell’s failure. This process caused the straight lines to appear wavy."
"One example of an illusion that we have covered in class would be the hollow face illusion. We discussed the hollow face illusion through the Gardner Dragon video example. The Gardner Dragon art work is used as an illusion when you face it straight on and can have the misleading perception of the head turning and twisting towards you if you were to move left or right. This is because of our perception of what a head should be and that is sticking out and not caved in. The hollow face illusion is also an example of a depth cue illusion because of this reason and is better explained through Julian Beevers sidewalk art in NYC, this being that the illusion becomes false when you are to walk to the side of the artwork and notice that it is actually just stretched out. "
"One example of an illusion we discussed in class was the visual illusion. This was evident in the green dragon sitting on the window. The face appeared to be coming at us at appeared to switch directions based on the camera angle but it was indeed flat the entire time. The perceptual process that was broken was depth cue it was misinterpreted depth cue leading us to believe objects are 3d when they are really flat.  "
"One illusion discussed in class is color illusions and how they are interpreted and processed that helps to explain the color in your eye. While mixing colors turns to a certain color, how light reflects off of certain colors determines how we see certain colors in our eyes and what we interpret them in our brain."
"One illusion discussed in class is the Ebbinghaus size illusion. The perceptive process that is broken is our sense of context. We perceive that the circle with the small circles around it is bigger than the circle with the large circles around. In reality, both circles in the center are the same size. Therefore, the context (the size of the circles surrounding the middle circle) makes us perceive something that is not correct."
"One illusion I thought of was the box with the white dots on the page you automatically think there is a box and you believe to see lines that connect but there not connect. You want to think in your head that those lines are connect and your brain is making you think they are because you say they are like the contrast it is really a black background with wite dots and the paper is flat down not up. "
"One illusion that we discussed in class was the rubber hand illusion.  In this illusion, a person's real hand is concealed from them and a fake rubber hand is place in front of them to view.  Both the fake hand and the real hand that is out of sight are stroked in some way and after a while, the person who's hand is being stroked starts to believe that the rubber hand is their real hand.  In this illusion, the perceptual process that is broken is the ability to distinguish between the fake hand and the real hand because of the fake hand being in the participants visual field and the real hand being out of sight."
"One illusion we discussed in class was contrast illusions. An example of this would be the inset squares and shading, the shading that occurred in the example made the inner squares seem like two different shades. However if you were to hole punch the center, you would be able to tell that it is actually the same shade. "
"One illusion we discussed in class was the face recognition illusion. This is a figure with five different pictures of the same face, but each face is warped slightly.  This is an example of top-down processing. "
"One illusion we discussed in class was the moon illusion. This is when the moon looks small when it's up in the sky, but when it sits on the horizon it looks huge. This illusion can be explained by our size and constancy perceptual processes being tricked. When the moon is up in the sky, it looks smaller, farther away, and there's nothing to compare it to besides tiny stars that are even farther away than the moon. On the other hand, when the moon is very close to the horizon, it looks so big because it's closer and you can compare it to the other objects you can see like buildings and mountains. We know that the moon doesn't change size, but the illusion makes us think so."
"One illusion we discussed in class was the picture of the two faces and the vase. This illusion was an example of figure-ground perception. The perceptual process it breaks is the illusion is based on what people focus on which leads to not seeing everything in the picture. With the black faces we see that because black is the foreground color and we do not see the vases because of it."
"One illusion we have studied in this lecture was color illusions. These are caused by wearing out the on-off receivers for the color you are looking at so it causes an after effect, so when you stop seeing that color you end up seeing the opposite color. For instance, when looking at the color yellow the on-off receptor for yellow is excited, and tells you that you are perceiving the color yellow. If you stare at this long enough, and then take away the picture and replace it with a space, then the on-off receptors is worn out and doesn’t perceive the color anymore. However, the off-on receptor for yellow will produce an after affect that tells you that you are no longer seeing yellow, so you must be seeing blue instead."
"One main type of brain research is behavioral research. This type of research works by examining behaviors of subjects  to infer processing. An example of this would be giving a monkey a banana and measuring response time as an indicator of mental processing."
"One of the illusions discussed in class was contrast illusions. Examples of contrast illusions could be experienced due to shading or inset squares. The perceptual process that is broken within a contrast illusion is the bottom up process as is deals with similarity and proximity. "
"One of the illusions discussed was a type of depth cue illusion called the Gardner dragon, which is a hollow face illusion. We expect faces to follow us, and our brains assume things about the structure of the face. Our brains incorrectly expect faces to come out at us in depth. When we move around the Gardner dragon, it appears that the dragon's head moves around to follow us.It twists and turns its head and follow our movements, until we look at the dragon from the side and see that it the structure of the face is not exactly what our brains assigned. Another of the illusions discussed was a type of size/constancy illusions. Participants are asked which line in the middle is longer, and people usually choose the incorrect line. They're actually the same length, but our Gestalt principals lead us to believe that one of the lines is longer because we use the entire photo to determine which line is longer rather than the line itself."
"One of the illusions that we discussed in class was the rubber hand illusion. In this illusion, a participant was seated in a chair with one arm in front of her. A rubber hand was then positioned on the other side to make it appear that it was part of her body. When the rubber hand was rubbed with the brush, the participant was eventually able to ""feel"" the sensations from the rubber hand. Since the rubber hand appeared to be realistic, the participant's brain eventually believed that the rubber hand was a part of the body and it was able to perceive the rubbing of the hand. "
"One of the illusions that we discussed in class was the rubber hand illusion. The rubber hand illusion shows us that at the beginning of the process we begin to perceive the rubber hand as our own hand that is attached to our body. We watched a video to help explain what that exactly means and the rubber hand was sometimes smacked really hard and typically the person doing the experiment would flinch even though they were not in any sort of physical pain what so ever. Sensation and perception is the process that is interrupted during this illusion. "
"One of the illusions we discussed in class is a depth cue illusion which would alter the way you think or see the depth in an object, picture, etc. An example would be if you were to look at a picture of a hallway that starts wide and gets smaller the further back it goes, with two objects in that hallway one towards the beginning of the hallway and one at the end, and the illusion is to see that the one at the end of the hallway is much bigger. In reality, the two objects are the same exact size. It made that object seem much bigger than the object that is at the beginning of the hallway because the depth of the hallway was made smaller with an object filling more space. This example would break the depth perception process that tricks your brain into thinking something is bigger than it actually is, by manipulating the depth."
"One of the illusions we discussed in class is the Ames room, which is a room that looks just like a regular room when you are facing it head on. But, if you watch a man step inside the room and head to the back of it, it will look like he is getting smaller. If he is in the back of the room and walks up to the front, it will appear that he is getting much larger. Our sight perception tells us that the man walking from the back of the room, toward the front of the room is getting smaller or larger, but in reality, the man stays the same size. We are deceived by our eyes, because when you take a closer look, you can see that the room is built on a hill or on steps, and the ceiling of the room is at a tilt. So they way this room is built, can trick our minds into think that the person in it is getting either bigger or smaller. "
"One of the illusions we discussed in class is the rubber hand illusion. The perceptual process that is broken in this illusion is sense versus perception."
"One of the illusions we discussed in class that breaks a perceptual process is the picture of all the blobs and where the blobs form a picture of a dog. This is a visual sensation that can give different perceptions . This conflicts top down and bottom up processing because it took me a significant period of time to finally see the dog in the picture but now that I have actually found the outline of the dog I cannot go back to just seeing a mess of blobs."
"One of the illusions we discussed in this class was the rubber hand illusion. This shows how when you hide your own hand and have both your hand and the fake rubber hand be rubbed with a brush at the same time, you'll process the information as if that fake hand is your own. This shows the break down of the perceptual process organization and interpreation. It starts with selection and how we focus on the information. Then moves to how we organize this information of the fake hand being rubbed as well as our own. We break this process by catagorizing the information as our own hand. We think because it is also being rubbed and we cannot see our own hand that it must be our own. This then also breaks the interpretation because we think that the hand is our own. "
"One of the illusions we discussed is the length of the arrow. We had to see what arrow was bigger. The one on the left looked bigger then the right. They ended up being the same size. The size/constancy illusion was broken in this process as we were all mislead thinking that one was bigger than the other."
"One of the illusions we discussed was the changed blindness experiment. We had to watch a movie perception test to see how many changes in the video we actually caught with our eyes. In the video there was two ladies sitting at a table discussing a surprise party. The screen would switch back and forth from one lady to another. After the video was over, I thought I did pretty well on catching all the changes, but I was wrong. I only got two changes out of a lot that actually happened. I think my brain was so focused on trying to find the changes, I got distracted by other things happening on the screen. I was also trying to pay attention to their conversation which also distracted me from observing the objects and changes that were taking place.  I think there were two perceptual processes broken in this illusion, presence of objects and observation. When you are so focused on one thing, you tend to get distracted and not realize what is going on around you. Also, when you are focused on one thing, you tend to not notice the presence of other objects around you. You become less observant because your mind has been taken over by one thing instead of looking and observing the whole situation. The more observant you are, the more objects you'll notice, and the less distracted you'll be. "
"One of the illusions we discussed was the dragon illusion. The illusion makes it look like the dragon's head moves, but in reality the dragon's head is just inverted so it creates the illusion of movement. The perceptual process that is broken is our depth cues. "
"One of the illusions we discussed was the moon illusion. In this illusion, the moon appears large when it is on the horizon than when in does in the sky. This breaks our perceptual process of size and cconsistency due to not having a point of comparison for when the moon is high in the sky. When the moon is on the horizon, there are many point of comparison to make the moon seem large."
"One of the illusions we have discussed in class was the rubber hand illusion the perceptual process that is broken during that illusion is that you actually perceive the hand as your own. So when your hand being smashed your brain processed that as being your real hand so you felt the sensation of your hand being smashed because the perceptual process of your real hand has been broken.Att"
"One of the illusions we studied in class was the Ames Room Illusion. This illusion incorporates all aspects except color. The room creates an illusion of relative sizes. When the man moves to the left side of the room, he appears much, much smaller. However, when moving to the right side of the room he appears to be much larger. This illusion breaks our top-down processing because in every day life we expect a person to stay the same size no matter what side of the room he/she is on. The illusion is created due to our assumed rectangular shape of the room, which, in this case, proves false. N"
"One of the illusions we studied included the depth cue illusions, these types of illusions play off our depth perception in which the perception of a 3D object is produced from a 2D object due to the way our brain sees to illusions. A particular illusion we discussed was the dragon figure, the dragons head was 2D but because of how it was positioned  and how we were positioned while viewing it tricked our depth perception into thinking it was 2D and in fact moving as we moved. "
"One of the illusions we talked about in class and my overall favorite illusion, is the rubber hand illusion. In the rubber hand illusion experiment subjects were seated at a table with a divider placed on it. On one side was the rubber hand and behind the divider was the subjects own real hand. The tester strokes the subjects hand as well as the rubber hand placed in front of the subject at the same time. During the experiment our brain perceives that the rubber hand is actually our own because we are looking directly at it, while also feeling the sensation of touch from the tester stroking our real hand. Our brain will actually adopt the rubber hand as its own. The sensory information from stroking the real hand sends transmitters throughout our body, but when the subject looks at the rubber hand placed in front of them, those transmitters sent to the brain will interpret the sense of touch and pair it with the rubber hand creating a perceptual illusion. The subject thinks the rubber hand is our own. The illusion created is because the sensory stimuli received from stroking the real hand registers with the body's sensory organs. The sensory organs then break down the information and transform them into neural impulses and send transmitters throughout the body to our brains. Our brains then receive the information and begin to interpret the sensory information, creating our perception of the illusion. "
"One of the illusions which was discussed in lecture was the Craik-Cornsweet-O'brien illusion. In this illusion, we see two rectangles with varying shades of gray. The rectangle on the left appears to be light gray and becomes lighter as it gets closer to the rectangle next to to. The rectangle on the left appears to be dark gray on the left and becomes lighter as it goes to the right. The illusion is that both rectangles are the same shade of gray if you hold your finger up to cover the extreme light and dark parts of the rectangles in the middle. We think the rectangle on the left is lighter than the rectangle on the right because of bottom up processing. Our eyes react negatively (throw the information away) to the outside part of the rectangles, which are the same color because our eyes react positively to the inside of the rectangles were there is a difference in color. Our eyes perceive the lights of these parts of the rectangles differently."
"One of the illusions(my favorite of all of them) is the Gardner Dragon illusion. In this illusion, it appears that the dragon is looking at you as you move to several different vantage points. In this illusion, depth cues are distorted and our expectation of outward protruding faces is tricked as we try to perceive an inward, concave face in the same manner."
"One research of the brain is behavioral. This research is when you measure the time to response or correct. We use the brain measurement to see the good and bad in things. For example, when a parent is trying to teach their kids right from wrong, they are utilizing behavioral research."
"one type of brain research includes memory research, This comes into play in neuropsychology and human development and there are many ways to conduct this research including recall expirements, recognition tests, and item identification and lists as well as many others. All of these tests entail the participants to recall or indentify a particular object or word/ symbol from a list or set of slides and the rate at which they remember or conditions of the test are recorded and studied. Memory is important to study because it shows us how the human brain stores and recalls information and how we process and organize information and whether or not it's retained and how. "
"One type of brain research is behavior brain research. This is very important in psychology. PET scans and other tests help view the parts of the brain that are being used in different behavioral activities and even abnormalities like bipolar disorder. With testing, researchers can see what parts of the brain are being affected by bipolar disorder and they can use this research to help come up with therapies and new medications that target these areas in the brain in order to best treat behavioral disorders. "
"One Type of brain research is behavioral research and this type of research measures the out-put on our system, and is observable. An example of behavioral research is us taking the class and our responses to homework quizzes and test and the observable data that shows if we are comprehending and understanding the material. Our responses to questions are the out-put of our brain and shows how well we are indeed understanding. This type of research shows either covert evidence where 2 task measure the same thing or divert evidence where 2 task measure a different thing. Having the correct answers for test will measure the accuracy of our answers the observable behavior."

"One type of brain research is behavioral research, which is observed through the behavior of the patient or the person that is being observed. Behavioral research measures output of our studies and measures such behaviors such as reaction times or accuracy, and has a couple ways of being ran. Measurable behavior studies can be split anywhere between ceiling effects- too easy and floor effects- too hard, and studies that are too easy or too hard can be non-helpful in a study. An example of brain research would be a study on animals who are forced to take certain types of drugs and see how they react to the drug. For example, giving a rat alcohol and measuring the output of the rats behaviors after the fact to shed light on how alcohol may affect a humans reaction time or awareness. "
"One type of brain research is behavioral research. In this research, we look at some behavior and evaluate it along some dimension. The idea is to measure some observable behavior and then based on that measurement, gain an idea of the internal locus of control. In other words, the behavior is a function of some unknown “thing” and we are trying to find out what that “thing” is. For example, we might try to figure out what allows people to remember visual representations of sequences of shapes and we might hypothesize that more longer sequences can be remembered if there are shapes alternating between few sides and many sides or between jagged shapes and curvy shapes. To test this, we could do a baseline of shorter sequences evaluating accuracy and time of the participant placing all the shapes in the correct order for similar shapes and different shapes and then try longer sequences as the experimental phase. This behavior of organizing the shapes is the observable, measurable behavior and the internal locus of control may be the cognition of the differences between the shapes."
"One type of brain research is Behavioral Research. This type of research only measures directly observable behaviors such as response or reaction times. One example of this research is Posner's Cueing Paradigm. In this research the reaction time of the participant is being measured from the time it takes for the researcher to flash the cue on the screen to the time it takes the participant's eyes to glance at the cue flashed."
"One type of brain research is behaviorism. The behaviorist wanted to observe stimuli, responses, and the consequences of those responses. There were some issues with this though with using people because some of the tests they had them doing, the people would be nervous how to react or answer because of the expectation so it wasn't always accurate. An example of this would be seeing how fast a persons reaction time is to being pinched. "
"One type of brain research is brain tumors. It is a neurological type of research that is performed by many doctors, psychologists, and other researches in the medical field. Most brain tumor researches include symptoms, causes, test to diagnose brain tumors, and different kinds of treatments. Some examples of how research is collected would be through general health examinations and blood tests. Health examinations could show symptoms of certain health concerns that could lead to brain tumors or signs of them, and blood tests could reveal chemical markers in the blood. Some tumors change the hormone balance in a person's body. "
"One type of brain research is by using the patient's blood. In this type of research, researchers use the oxygen in the blood to measure where the brain signal is. There are a few types of this research: PET, MRI, fMRI, and MEG. In a PET the patient is injected with a radioactive dye. The active area has an increased blood flow and the radioactive isotype dye shows this. In a MRI the patient is put inside a machine that scans the body. The magnetic fields align only certain ions and compounds and this shows up on the scan. An fMRI is multiple MRI scans, but this process is cleaner and faster, but more expensive than just an MRI. An MEG is an even faster and cleaner version of an MRI. "
"One type of brain research is called the Sperry's split brain experiment which is studying how life would be if your corpus callosum was cut and how your brain can still process information when the brain is working as two separte peices."
"One type of brain research is causal brain research. Casual brain research studies how drugs, lesions and injuries affect the brain. One example of this type of research is the case of Phineas Gage. Phineas Gage had a steel rod go through his brain. It was reported the injury changed his behavior and he was quick to anger and lost his job."
"One type of brain research is causal brain research. Causal research tries to discover the actual part of the brain that does a specific something. Through causal research, a scientist tests theories about what specific areas of the brain are responsible for. Causal research is preferred over correlational research as it can find more specific areas of the brain, rather than just general ones. One example of causal research is TMS or transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS temporarily disrupts a small area of brain activity to discover what that area of the brain does. If TMS was administered to the Broca's area, for instance, producing speech would become difficult directly after. "
"One type of brain research is cognitive brain research. Cognitive brain research is research that involves looking into things such as emotions, our memory and our thoughts. This brain research has become more and more important especially in the area of psychology. This type of research can be done by doing experiments that involve using our memory, much like the experiments that we have done in this class and then analyzing the data that we come up with.  Another example of how cognitive brain research can be conducted is by using neuro imaging. This can be done by doing a scan on an individuals brain and looking at how the brain has developed from childhood to adulthood. "
"One type of brain research is cognitive science. One example of this type of research is how we use artificial intelligence to try and mimic how a human brain works. We compare data received from a computer to data received from real individuals to see if they are processing things in the same way."
"One type of brain research is correlation research, which is basically comparing two things to see how they are related to one another but NOT saying that they cause one another. You are just looking at two different aspects and correlating them with each other to make sense of each thing to see if they could at all be related and it will give you a better idea if they possibly could be caused by one another but you cannot say that for certainty. One example of this type of research is a fMRI which is a functional magnetic resonance imaging which is used more for brain research than say a CAT scan. A cat scan can be done on any part of the body but may not always show things. However with an MRI and a fMRI they are able to show more especially in the brain area because of the make-up of the brain. In an fMRI, they are looking at how your brain works through multiple MRI scans, when you go from doing absolutely nothing, to having you do something specific to see what area of the brain is being specifically triggered by that thing they are having you do. Your brain is always actively working in all areas of the brain but they are able to look at those images to see how it is affected immediately after that thing they are having you do to see what changed from nothing to something. There are several different types of research done on the brain that are all affect, however I found this type to be more affect and interesting because of my dad currently have several MRI and fMRI's done on his brain recently. "
"One type of brain research is correlation research.  The correlational research design reveals the pattern of brain activity but do not lead to the causation of this activity.  These types of studies usually rely on brain imaging scans such as fMRIs and MRIs in order to view the brain and study its different areas."
"One type of brain research is correlational neuro-imaging or brain imaging. The oldest correlational methods record brain activity from the scalp. EEG or electroencephalography, uses electrodes placed on the head to record fluctuations of electrical activity of the brain over time. For example, it can track the stages of sleep, and also detect activity to different auditory responses. There are many different types of neuro imaging methods. These methods include EEG, PET or positron emission tomography which can detect activity in language areas as different subjects speak. Other methods include the MRI, magnetic resonance imaging, and optical imaging, which all focus to show the structure of the brain and measure its activity."
"One type of brain research is correlational research. Correlational brain research is used for determining a relationship between multiple variables. This brain research helps find similarities and differences in participants. There are several methods of correlational measures to conduct this research. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a specific method to test how active the brain is by using electricity. Electrical activity can help predict if there are abnormalities or disorders in the brain. Brain waves are measured through electrical impulses and recorded. This method does not necessarily predict the cause of a problem, partly due to the lack of spatial resolution produced by this test. In fact, there are several disadvantages to using correlational methods for research due to the brain. EEG only shows the electrical activity, but neglects to determine whether this activity is positive or negative. However, the correlation obtained can give help a researcher get an idea of a potential problem based on the relationship of variables for what is being tested."
"One type of brain research is known as the neuroimaging method. Research via neuroimaging is the study of brain structure with one or more of many different tools. A good example of this would be the use of an EEG machine. EEG stands for electroencephalography and it uses electrodes placed on the scalp to record fluctuations in electrical activity over time. The fluctuations being observed can then be interpreted as brain activity. The frequency of the waves can actually help determine the exact emotion a patient is feeling. A German psychiatrist known as Hans Berger, was the inventor of EEG in 1924."
"One type of brain research is magnetic resonance imaging, otherwise known as an MRI. This type of scan uses magnetic fields to change the atoms in a substance. This results in a image being created based on the functioning of the brain in response to the magnetic fields. "
"One type of brain research is motor cognition. This looks into why people might choke under pressure and how an athlete's brain works. The research done was experimental by mesuring how quickly athlete's brain answers a matching test with sentences and pictures. "
"One type of brain research is on the study of brain diseases. Specifically alzheimers research. This type of research is designed to study all parts of the brain. Multiple parts of your brain are affected when you have alzheimers. Things  like the cortex, hippocampus, and ventricles are affected when you have alzheimers. Some ways they study this is by examaning brain tissue underneath a microscope. "
"One type of brain research is perceptual research through the mental rotation experiment. Basically, giving people different objects and seeing how long it takes them to identify whether you could rotate the object and it will match the second object. "
"One type of brain research is physical research that includes searching for physical ailments such as tumors located in the brain. "
"One type of brain research is research on mental rotation. This type of research studies how we rotate visual images. Some examples of experiments used in this type of research are showing one letter, and flipping them and asking if they are still the same by rotating it clockwise, counterclockwise, and 180 degrees. Some of the results of this research show that some rotate familiar figures faster, rotate clear pictures faster than blurry pictures, and it becomes slower as we age."
"One type of brain research that is common, is correlational, or when we study what is happening in the brain without manipulating variables. Sometimes it is totally unethical to manipulate the variables, and make someone do something or act a certain way. In these cases you can only do correlational studies instead of a causal study. This is because you can’t exactly pin point that what you’re studying is the only variable effecting the brain, since there maybe be confounding factors. Examples of these studies would be an EEG, ERP and EMG. These are the correlational studies that specifically use electric impulses, there are more that do not use electricity. The Electricity studies are done by placing electrodes on the head and seeing if an electrical fire takes place after a certain task or picture is seen. The neurons send electrical signals so it is thought that the places with the active electrical impulses would be in response to the neurons in that area firing. These are good for quick data collection, being relatively inexpensive, and not being invasive. However, the down side to this style of brain testing is that you cannot tell specifically where the firing is coming from, only a general area.  "
"One type of brain research that is very popular today is the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test. This is a type of correlational neuroimaging method of brain research. This type of test includes the use of a magnetic that causes atoms in the brain to move with the use of radio waves. This ultimately allows for an accurate image to be taken of the brain. An example of this type of research is if a patient goes to the hospital with a head injury, the doctor may perform this type of scan to ensure that no significant damage has been done. This type of scan is also used to determine if a patient has a cancerous tumor in their brain. "
"One type of brain research we studied was Correlational Brain Research. One example of Correlational Brain Research is the fMRI or Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The fMRI can detect activity in various sections of the brain."
"One type of brain research would be behavioral research.  Using a behavioral method to conduct research allows researchers to observe and record behaviors to make inferences about what's going on in the brain.  One example that is often used within behavioral research is the measurement of accuracy.  For example, participants would be given a list of words and later a memory recall test.  The accuracy of the answers on the recall test would then be measured to see how effectively participants processed the words being viewed previous to the memory recall test.  Ceiling and floor effects are two major limitations that come along with conducting behavioral research.  If the experiment was too difficult or too easy, this could lead to bias, unusable data.  "
"One type of brain research would be brain anatomy research, which would include the parts of the brain and their functions. An example of this research could be a pet scan or MRI which shows activity within the brain. Or testing a subject that's suffered Damage to a specific part of their brain to see the effects. "
"One type of brain research, neuropsychological to be specific, is looking at brain images and watching each section as it pertains to certain body movements. Whenever there is more activation in a part of the brain, a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan would show the activity in regions of the brain as tasks require certain brain patterns. This is possible because of the small number of radioactive isotopes being injected into the blood. The stimulated areas will show more blood flow represented by different colors on the image. "
"One type of common brain research is Correlational brain research. the point of this type of research is to compare how one stimulation on the outside of the body affects how the brain feels and works as the stimulation is happening. There is no manipulation, but rather just telling the individual to do something and comparing brain activity. One example of a correlational brain research tool is an electroencephalogram (EEG). This type of imaging gives physicians and scientists a look at electrical labor throughout the brain. The test is fairly quick, does not take too long to measure. The test may be uncomfortable for the patient due to the electrode stickers that have to be placed on the scalp with wires sticking out in every which way. The test is not painful and is also not very expensive. "
"One type of research discussed in lecture was correlational brain research. This type of research measures neural activity from information processing and compares it to known data or acquired data, sometimes data taken from viewing behavior or from behavioral research. Such research can provide insight into neural activity and establish associations or dissociations. For example, a neural task, when looking at electrical brain activity, could cause an area of the brain to become active as well as other areas to a lesser extent due to different areas of the brain (some more than others) being needed to complete the task. However, nothing is being manipulated in this research, meaning it is solely correlational, not causational. Correlational research can be evaluated in four different aspects, which are as follows: spatial resolution (where the brain activity is present or located), temporal resolution (how quickly the brain activity can be or is tracked), invasiveness resolution (the degree of pain involved in the testing), and cost (how expensive it is to conduct the research and to acquire the equipment). An example of a correlational type of research would be measuring brain electrical activity. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a device that measures the electrical activity of different areas of the brain using electrodes to see where electric potentials are firing. An Event Related Potential (ERP) also uses electrodes but helps to measure the size of the electrical waves coming from different areas of the brain. The size of the electrical waves can change depending on the stimuli or what it is being exposed to. Using these devices, one is able to correlate task(s) or stimuli given to individuals to the electrical activity of the brain at the time of the task(s) or stimuli. This example of correlational research has several advantages: the data is retrieved within seconds, there is almost no pain (maybe a slight headache), and it is fairly inexpensive (only costing several thousand dollars). On the other hand, it is does not have good spatial resolution because it is unable to detect precisely where the neurons of the brain are being activated. "
"One way I've thought of embodied cognition has been an extended mind. It extends the idea that the body is connected to the mind and goes even further to say that the body can actually influence the mind. In our lecture, we talked about how embodied cognition is basically when you imagine doing something, your brain is going through those steps as if you are actually doing it. Thus, the environment, or our experiences, play a role in influencing cognition and our abilities are not limited to only the brain. A simple example is gesturing or using fingers to count. Instead of storing the information only in our mind, we use our fingers to count and then result back to the physical world (our hand) to see the number we counted. "
"Our different sensations are what cause the perception of what is and what is not. It is important that we study these differences because our sensations affect what we perceive. Just as in the rubber hand illusion, their sensations of beginning to think that the rubber hand is their own because of the stroking of the brushes leads to their perception that the hand is their own. If we did not realize the differences between sensation and perception we would not be able to conduct experiments such as that because we would not know that although they are different, the correlations between the two cause the perception. "
"path 1. Neurons are excitable cells that transmit information electrically, through action potentials, and chemically, through the release of neurotransmitters. Action potentials travel across neurons in a fashion that mimics a Mexican wave; it quickly rises and falls and either completely occurs or does not occur at all. Neurotransmitters are released from a neuron’s axon terminal at the end of the Mexican wave before travelling across a synapse and binding to receptors on another neuron. One location in the brain at which neurons communicate through a Mexican wave and the release of neurotransmitters is in the frontal lobe of the brain. The frontal lobe is the foremost section of the brain and is important in language, abstract thinking, and attention. One of the major parts of the frontal lobe is Broca’s area which is responsible for formulating speech. Without action potentials in neurons in Broca’s area, language would not be produced and an individual would not be able to speak coherently."
"path 1. The difference between sensation, input from the environment, and perception, interpretation or understanding of the input, is studied because sensation cannot adequately describe perception. In fact, people often interpret sensations differently. For example, some people enjoy eating jalapenos while other people might think they are way too spicy. Similarly, some people might think sixty degree weather is nice while others are really cold in that temperature. Another reason the difference is studied is because, while both are linked to the brain, sensation is more of a biological process while perception is a cognitive process."
"path 2. One area of focus within cognitive psychology is attention. Attention is the process of focusing on some kind of stimuli while simultaneously tuning out others. It is both a behavioral and cognitive process that is controlled primarily by the frontal lobes of the brain. Like most things, attention is not always perfect; sometimes the attention process is successful but sometimes it fails. One instance in which attention is successful is endogenous (controlled) attention. Endogenous attention is a type of top down processing and is voluntary; we choose what to attend to and then work to ignore everything else. Searching for Volkswagen beetles is an example of this. While driving around town you might pass hundreds of different cars, yet somehow it is not too difficult to hone in on the slug bugs among all of those cars because of where you have chosen to place your attention. On the other hand, an example of when attention fails is change blindness. Change blindness is when someone fails to see a change in their visual field. For example, a person texting while driving might not see a car brake in front of them. Another example is that people might not notice when the people at the table next to them in a restaurant leave or get their food. One way to test attention and judge a person’s ability to change their focus is with Posner’s cueing paradigm. Studies using this tool have discovered that people are slower to switch their attention if they are miscued on where to look but are actually relatively fast if they are cued correctly."
"path 3. Cognitive psychology is a subset of psychology that focuses on thoughts, memory, speech, and other similar processes of the mind that are not directly observable. Pursued as a result of behaviorism in 1957, cognitive psychology is a science that focuses on empirical studies, or experiments, that shed light on cause and effect relationships of unobservable thinking processes by influencing at least one factor (independent variable) in order to analyze another factor (dependent variable). These experiments test theories and then consequently help generate more theories that seek to explain the mind-brain connection, or the overlap between the brain and what we term “the mind”. One area of study within cognitive psychology is artificial intelligence. Through many experiments, cognitive psychologists are making progress in simulating the human mind-brain connection in different types of technology, such as in phones and vehicles, in order to make the computer systems more human-like."
"path 4. As a result of behaviorism’s inability to explain the parts of human nature that could not directly be seen, such as language and perception, the cognitive area of psychology emerged at the MIT symposium that took place in 1957. Early on, the development and explanation of cognitive science was linked to the expanding computer technology of the time."
"path 4. People can form perceptions through two different processes – top down processing and bottom up processing. Perceptions formed through top down processing are influenced by context and an individual’s background knowledge, experiences, and expectations. An example of top down processing is the word superiority effect. Word superiority explains that people typically try to see or make words when they see letters. This is because people expect letters to form words instead of just being a random string of letter due to their lifetime experience with words. Perceptions formed with bottom up processing, however, are influenced by sensory information taken in. An example of bottom up processing is the feature matching theory, which claims that people identify different objects based on physical characteristics (“features”) that are unique to them. For instance, when trying to read really bad handwriting, people can try to make out individual letters or words based on curves, points, and length. Similarly, the concept of the feature matching theory can be applied to a police line-up when a witness is trying to identify a criminal based on a set of appearance characteristics. "
"path 6. One experiment we discussed in this section is the pattern change experiment. This participants’ task in this experiment was to find a single letter amongst a variety of other distracting letters and then to identify the letter to the right of that target letter. In some trials the target letter was hidden among letters with similar features (conjunctive background), and in other trials the target letter was hidden among letter with contrasting features (disjunctive background); this was the independent variable. The two primary feature distinctions of the letters were curved (e.g., “C”) and pointy (e.g., “X). The dependent variable was the accuracy at which the participants could identify the letter to right of the target letter."
"path 7. I think breaking the parietal lobe would be the worst lobe to break in the brain for multiple reasons. First, the parietal lobe is the key in controlling memory, such as storage and retrieval, and memories play such a huge role in shaping our personalities. Second, the parietal lobe is the area of the brain that is responsible for processing touch, temperature, pain, and pressure sensation, as well as determining the body’s location in space (proprioception). These factors are beneficial for many reasons, but safety and self-preservation are probably the most notable ones. "
"path 8. One popular illusion we discussed in class is the Meuller-Lyer illusion. This illusion presents two lines side by side, one with arrow tips on the end and one with inverted arrow tips on the end. Even though the lines are equal lengths, people usually say the line with the inverted arrow tips is longer than the other one. This is an illusion playing on the perceptual process of understanding size constancy. "
"path 9.  One type of cognitive map is a route map. A route map is like the list view of the directions you might get on MapQuest; it tells you how to get from one place to another with explicit steps. For example, concerning finding a physical location, a route map might consist of “go straight on street X and then turn right onto street Y.” Similarly, applied to finishing a task at work, a supervisor might say “first do X, then do Y, and finally do Z.” I use this in my daily life often, such as when someone comes into my work asking for directions because they are not familiar with Springfield and when I am training at my new job (e.g., learning how to operate an ultrasound machine)."
"Pattern recognition involves top down processing and bottom up processing. Bottom up processing is driven off of data or stimulus. This means we use only the data to make our desicions. Opposite to that is top down processing which is driven by theories or concepts. This means that we use our own personal knowledge or theories along with the data to process the information. Within bottom up theories of pattern recongition we find feature matching theory. This theory states that we break down visual information presented into logcial features and then match them with stored information that matches these features. We see this theory being applied in word superirity. Word superiority is a theory about how we can recognize letters better when they are put along side other words instead of being put alone or with anything other than letters. This is because when we use the feature matching theory we are breaking down the letters into shapes and angles. This process enables us to easily identify the letters because we have stored information about their shapes and angles. This proves word superiority to be true. "
"Perception is a product of both bottom-up and top-down processing. We rely on both types of processing in everyday life, and in many situations, we use both of them interchangeably. Bottom-up processing is when sensory information is used, while top-down processing is based on context, often driven by prior knowledge, experience, and expectation. Bottom-up processing allows us to take in information using sight, touch, smell, taste, and hearing. This information is then transferred from the body to the brain. The sensory information that is collected is passed on to the brain, then the brain determines our emotions, or how we perceive it. In other words, bottom-up processing moves from integral pieces to the bigger perception. For example, using the Gestalt grouping principle of closure, bottom-up processing uses the senses to visualize a series of lines, then the mind perceives that picture as a closed figure of something familiar to us and makes sense of the open-ended lines, as in the case of the unfinished star. Another way to understand bottom-up processing is through the Feature Matching Theory. The Feature Matching Theory is a way to take simple characteristics and determine objects that match. Feature matching models are capable of more simple recognition, as well as more complex feature recognition, and depending on the level of complexity, the model may require few to several stages of detectors. If a feature is present that the matching model is aware of, then that results in a match. Feature matching also supports the idea that the brain is parallel. Letter and word recognition are determined through the feature matching model. Neurons are capable of detecting edges, curvature, straight lines, and slants, and use this information to form letters. Letters that are formed are then used for word recognition. All of these features, each of which is in a separate receptive field, are being detected at the same time. On the other hand, top-down processing is the opposite. The brain is active first, then the body is able to react based on how the brain perceives the situation. Top-down processing does not focus on features as much, instead it is much more about heuristics. Context and situation is much more influential in top-down processing. How we perceive something can really depend on the setting. Top-down processing is also responsible for word superiority, which is the ability to make sense of letters to detect a word. Word superiority is based on expectations and again can result in something completely different depending on the current setting. Top-down processing relies heavily on expectations. Illusions are techniques that alter expectations of our perceptual process, which is helpful with studying perception.  "
"Personally, I think the Temporal Lobe is the worst to ""break."" The hippocampus is a part of the temporal lobe and with diseases such as Alzheimer's the hippocampus is the first area of the brain to be effected. As someone who has watched a family member suffer through alzheimer's and eventually die from the disease, I think this is the worst part to break. It is hard to watch someone lose their memories, their facial recognition, and comprehension of a conversation. All of these functions are located in the temporal lobe. Breaking this lobe not only effects that individual person, but also the people who have to watch them go through it. "
"Positron emission tomography is a procedure where the blood flow of the brain can be seen by placing radioactive isotopes into the blood. This type of research shows which parts of the brain are linked to which mental or physical activities. PET can be used to compare the blood flow of people with and without mental handicaps such as alzheimers. Often people with brain damage or issues will have lower blood flow in specific lobes compared to others' healthy brains."
"Posner's cueing paradigm explained differences in attention. Our class saw a video where someone asked a stranger for directions. In the middle of the directions, two men moving something walked in between the two people talking. At the same time, the stranger needing attention switched out with another person. The person who was giving directions rarely noticed the change. This phenomenon is called change blindness. Attention is directing focus to something of importance. There are different kinds of attention. Endogenous attention is a top down process in which your attention is directed based on your goals. Controlled attention is more bottom up of a process where your attention is more of a reflex to a stimuli."
"Posner's Cueing Paradigm: A visual cueing task to show the difference between controlled and uncontrolled attention. Uses a center target and monitors reaction time to a stimulus shown on the screen."
"Posner’s cueing paradigm focuses on exogenous and endogenous attention, while change blindness focuses on our lack of attention. During the experiment concerning change blindness, we were told that there were going to be changes made during the video in order to pay attention to count the changes. However, most of the class did not notice any of the changes. Therefore, we used endogenous attention (controlled) because we had prior knowledge that there were going to be changes in the video before we watched it."
"Posner’s cueing paradigm is a test used to measure a person’s ability to see endogenous stimuli while the participant uses endogenous or controlled attention where they pay attention to the small + in the center of the page. Many participants think that they are paying attention or absorbing all the information that is in the entire testing area, but if a black line was introduced the participant would likely miss the black line, this is called change blindness where the participant does not pay attention to the black line stimuli."
"Posners - if you have a cue showing you what you're looking for, you'll find it more quickly and efficiently Than if you don't. "
"Psychologist often seek to understand individuals ability to pay attention, which is the ability to concentrate on information. Most importantly an individuals endogenous attention, and their ability to choose the area of concentration. Psychologist conduct experiments, to try and understand  a phenomenons called change blindness. Which is how individuals are able to focus on certain aspects but miss others. An example of this would be trying to remember which bowl the ball is underneath, while doing this the experimenter might have done something like change they color of the ball, the lights flicker, or they wouldn't notice a mouse run across the floor. To do this they use tests like Posner's cueing paradigm to determine an individuals likelihood of focusing their attention on several stimuli at once. Posner would have participants focus on a stimuli and record their reaction time to variable stimuli. "
"Psychology began as a philosophy, or a thinking science. Willhelm Wudnt founded the first psychology lab in 1879 in Germany, and was really interested in many association studies. Edward Titchner was a study under Wundt who expanded on a lot of the work they had done to cover all of the mental activity instead of simply sensation and feelings. They showed that mental activity can be separated and broken down into many working pieces, and developed several ways for assessing this mental activity.  "
"Psychology has roots as a thinking science stemming from philosophy, studying explanations for everyday observations. Cognitive psychology, as a science of its own, started in Germany, and much of the foundational research that is used by cognitive psychologists today is based in Europe. Wilhelm Wundt began studying introspection at his lab in Germany in 1879. Introspection is the process of internal perception or inner exploration to assess one’s own mental activity. The problem with introspection and the study of it is that it is inconsistent across subjects. It assumes that people are always honest in answering questions about how they feel, but that is not always the case. Edward Titchener, an American student of Wundt, began to further the research to study all mental activity, not just sensations and feelings. Wundt’s lab made two main contributions to the field of cognition. First, they presented the idea that mental activity can be broken down into many simple operations. Second, they began to develop objective methods for evaluating mental activity. In America, the popular psychologist William James was laying further groundwork for the cognitive field. His focus was on the function of mental activity, rather than the nature of it. He developed the functionalist approach, which is the idea that specific tactics are better for completing certain tasks than others. Over time, due to gaining experience, we change our thoughts and behaviors to better adapt to our environment. Next, behaviorism developed as an objection to introspection. Behaviorists wanted to focus more on things that could be measured and observed. Clark L. Hull was one of the first major players in behaviorism. He believed that internal events are best explained by outward actions. B. F. Skinner is the most well known of the behaviorists. Skinner rejected the idea of internal events all together. He thought that thinking was not something that could be described. Behaviorism lost momentum because it could not be used to describe basic human behaviors like language. It also lacked the ability to describe perception. During the 1950s through the 1970s, cognition emerged as a response to behaviorism. The 1957 MIT symposium presented the idea of using computers to conduct applied cognitive research. The computer provided a new way to think about the processes of the brain. Simon, Newell, and Chomsky were essential to this new approach, presenting ideas of how the computer could be used as a reference point for the brain allowing for progress to be made in the field. The military helped to further the study of cognition because they found cognitive testing to be useful in their evaluation of soldiers and methods. Also, Miller’s Magic Number paper was published and became famous for his research into memory. Scientists began researching cognitive psychology for a few reasons. First, they had genuine curiosity about how the brain works. Second, they had a desire to collaborate with other researchers. Third, they knew it would be a good way to make money because cognition research is lucrative in that it is interwoven with everyday life."
"Psychology was seen as a philosophy, and in 1879, in Leipzig Germany, was the first laboratory headed by Wilhelm Wundt. Wilhelm was studying psychology because it was seen as looking inside yourself. The school in Germany showed that mental activity had many parts and thus began the research that is still going on and being studied today. "
"richardson Bottleneck theory is the model of attention that describes how your cognition handles too much information at once. When there is too much going on, it is not possible to process all of the stimulus at the same time. The brain has to handle the stimulus piece by piece instead of all at once. If it attempts to handle two piece of the information at the same time then it will not be as accurate as if it only had to focus on one thing."
"richardson Broca’s area is the part of the brain that is helping me to tell my fiance to turn down the cardinal’s game at the moment so that I can concentrate on writing this. It is the place in the brain where you decide what and how you are going to say something in response to someone. When I tell him “yes, of course I love the cardinals, but I need to focus” those are messages that I got from neurotransmitters that were fired from other neurons. The neurotransmitters sent messages through chemicals from the tip of axons to the synapses of the next neuron. The mexican wave is then set off, an electrical process that allows the communication within neurons. From that, the message is communicated to my broca’s area. This area is located in the frontal lobe, the front part of the brain that processes abstract thinking and speech production. This area of the brain also allows me to think abstractly about the cardinal’s season so far and their potential for the world series."
"richardson Cognitive psychology is the study of the brain and how we understand and percieve the world. The mind-brain theory looks at the way our thoughts and feelings, those once intangible emotions, are effected by the brain. It is amazing how far the study has come, once thought of as a “black box” we are now able to see electrical currents and brain waves while doing experiments on the brain. Experments allow us to test theories and casual relationships by manipulating variables. One of the biggest things that is being experimented on in the study of cognition is how we can recreate the mind in a computer program, this is the purpose of studying artificial intelligence. Once an experiment shows a new piece of information on how we process information, they will then use the turing test to see if the same information can be acceesed in the same way with AI. If not, then there are tweeks made to the AI system, and the cycle continues to try to find a perfect replication of how our mind-brain works."
"richardson In the converging lines illusion, lines that are the same size are made to look different sizes because of the background. It is assumed when we look at the picture that the bottom line is closer because the background of that is the front of the train tracks. It is then assumed that the line on top is further away since the background looks like the train tracks are getting smaller and further away in the image. Because we compare the lines to the train tracks image, it is difficult to tell that the lines are the same size. This is an example of both depth cue illusion and size consistency effects that have been broken through the illusion."
"richardson One type of brain research is casual neural methods, it studies the activity that a specific piece of your brain is responsible for. A type of this is transnuchial magnetic stimulation (TMS), it stops a part of the brain from working properly for a short amount of time. It also researches the study of how specific pieces of the brain effect cognition. It is an alternative to researching people with brain damage so that researchers can know what piece of the brain is being altered. With victims of brain damage it is not possile to know what other effects the trauma had on the rest of the brain."
"richardson Our brains go through a lot to just even sit here at the computer. At the moment while writing this I am using top down processing, by thinking about the bigger picture and my own knowledge to come up with the words to type. While I am typing this, bottom up processing is happening, my attention is drawn outwards to a stimulus that catches my ear. The sound of my daughter giggling and screaching. Though I can only see part of her blonde head over the computer and couch, I know through feature matching theory that it is her. The pieces that I can see and the context give me enough information to conclude that it is Ella. Word superiority works in the same way, even when you don’t have the ability to see a whole word, your brain makes assumptions based on what you do see. Our brains want to find meaning in what we see."
"richardson Philosophers started theorizing very early but it wasn’t until the late 1800’s in Germany that there was a science made out of studying the mind and how it works. From those first studies and theories came cognitive psychology which was first starting to really be researched after the first computer at MIT. It allowed the researchers to not only have new tools for research but it also gave them a new way to compare thoughts and the retriecal of ideas, memories and every other piece of information that is kept in our brains."
"richardson The test on how athletes brain worked showed that the athletes were able to identify images of players postures faster than athletes in other sports. They researched hockey and football players, the IV was the types of questins that were asked and the sports that they played, the DV was the reaction time to answering what the images were."
"richardson We study the difference in sensation and perception so that we can study the specific areas of the brain and figure out how they are involved in our cognitive fuction. The sensations we have of the world and how we percieve those sensations are the basis for how we understand our surroundings.  Without researching the different parts of each, we would not know how to begin to help those that have damage to these areas, like in akinetopsia."
"richardson With the attention that is used to watch the Cardinal’s game, I am concentrating on and attending to the information on the screen. There are times that I don’t even notice the score of the bottom of the screen. When I am just focusing on Garcia for example, using endogenous attention, I am thinking about the season so far and how his pitch will affect the game and the rest of the season. That happens while I focus on the baseball. During the pitch the ball moves so fast that instead of just focsing on the ball I move my attention from the pitchers hand to the mound and then I focus on the ball being hit or a strike happening. This is an example of the implications of Posner’s cueing paradigm. I am focused on the big picture, seeing only parts of the informations to pay attention to. I could possibly be missing details or even bigger pieces of information, like in change blindess, I am only focused on the bigger picture."
"Say you want to speak to your friend. This may seem simple enough, as the latency between you deciding you want to speak and actually speaking is normally less than a second, but one might be surprised to know exactly how much happens to make sounds. First, neurons in your brain start firing. They receive neurotransmitters, or chemical signals such as dopamine or hormones, from other neurons, which triggers a response if they fit like a lock and key into the receptors of the neuron. Once a response is triggered to the threshold, it creates an action potential; there are no half measures, it's all or nothing. An action potential, sometimes called the Mexican Wave, is an electrical impulse that travels down a neuron through a flood of positive ions in the neuron. Once the Mexican Wave has traveled the length of the neuron, it releases its own neurotransmitters to seek out neurons that will have the correct receptors. This pattern continues throughout neurons all within the brain, seeking to find the right one that will tell your mouth to start forming words. It is looking for the frontal lobe of the brain, which is located behind the forehead and responsible for actions like abstract thinking, attention, and what we are looking for: speech production. Speech production is primarily held with the Broca's area in the frontal lobe. Once neurons in the Broca's area begin firing, you begin to speak. Overall, there's a lot more happening to do simple tasks than most even realize. "
"Schoenrock 1. Sensation is how the information is processed by sensory receptors and perception is how these sensations are processed in the brain. We study them differently because for one sensation there can be multiple perceptions. An example from the PowerPoint is the picture of the blobs that could also be a pattern of a dog. We study sensation and perception differently so we can understand why one sensation (the picture overall) can be two perceptions (either blobs or a dog)."
"Schoenrock 1. The Mexican Wave is a short lasting event in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls causing an action potential to travel along the neuron in an all or nothing response. When it reaches the axon terminus, it releases neurotransmitters into the synapse that bind to the receptors that it fits. These neurotransmitters can be a variety of things such as serotonin and dopamine. This process is present everywhere in the body including the frontal lobe. This area of the brain is in the front (towards the forehead) and contains the primary motor cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and Broca’s area. Broca’s area is the sight of speech production. When an action potential dumps neurotransmitters in synapses in this part of the brain, it allows us to talk. "
"Schoenrock 2. Attention is when a person makes an effort to focus on a particular aspect of information while disregarding other information. This can be in the form of looking, listening, or thinking about the information. Endogenous attention or controlled attention is an attentional process that involves some sort of voluntary aspect. This is considered a success of selection. Attention is critical to one’s ability to detect change. This is apparent in the change blindness phenomenon. This is when a person fails to notice a change in a visual stimulus. Change blindness is considered a failure of selection. Posner’s Cueing Paradigm is a way to measure this (failure or success). He found that when they are cued correctly, people were quick to name the target and very slow when they were miscued. "
"Schoenrock 3. Cognitive psychology is the study of the mind and mental function. Scientists liken the brain to a complex computing system. This idea led to artificial intelligence. This is the idea that a computer can mimic the mind and act like a human. This inspired other research and experiments in the field. These experiments looked for causal relationships between variables by manipulating the variables. This is where theories arise which lead to other experiments. The mind brain approach is a theory that tries to determine if and where the mind and brain connect. They are now thought to be the same thing, just different levels of analysis."
"Schoenrock 4. Cognitive psychology started in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the development of the computer. Scientists used the computer to describe how the brain worked. Three major players early in the game included Simon Newell, and Chomsky. They showed how the mind could be compared to a computer and opened the door for many new theories and research in the field."
"Schoenrock 4. Top-down processing is when background knowledge and the person’s expectations are used to create a picture of perception. An example of this is word-superiority. This says that we perceive letters to always spell a word. Our background knowledge of words allows for this. Bottom-up processing is creating a picture of perception using sensory input or the stimulus. Feature matching theory utilizes this premise. This theory states that a person will match things based on a set of specific features that the object requires. Feature matching theory originates at the stimulus or object and processes it from there (the bottom up)."
"Schoenrock 5. Embodied cognition is when you are actually doing something that you think you are just imagining yourself doing. The best example of this involves Broca’s area and includes singing, talking, or humming to yourself.  "
"Schoenrock 6. The chimeric face experiment was over which hemisphere of our brains processed the faces that where shown. The faces were split down the middle and had different expressions on each side. The dependent variable was which hemisphere processed the faces and the independent variable were the actual faces. The groups were the left and right hemisphere processors."
"Schoenrock 7. In my opinion, the worst lobe to break would be the occipital lobe. I would never want to lose my sight. I could go without speaking, hearing, and smelling. Being able to see people’s body language and facial expression is important to me because I think that it gives away more about the person’s true thoughts and feeling than just words do."
"Schoenrock 8. The visual cliff study involved a checkered table cloth placed beneath a sheet of Plexiglas. The table cloth was flat up until a certain point where it dropped about four feet. Infants that were of crawling age where studied by allowing them to crawl along the Plexiglas towards their parent. The researchers were hypothesized that depth perception was innate and was not taught. The results of the study showed just that. Depth perception was the perceptual process that was broken in this illusion."
"Sensation and perception are not the same thing and it is important to know the difference between the two. Sensation is what is being sensed, whether it be sight, smell, touch, taste, or hearing. In other words, the information that is being detected is what is referred to as sensation. How we identify and interpret the specific sensory stimulus is known as perception. Perception relies on how our minds process or perceive the sensation. Sensation by itself does not produce meaning, however perception allows the sensory information to be rationalized. The two work synergistically. Perception is important to understand because without it, we would be unable to make sense of what is happening. Perception can help explain human behavior and cognition. It varies from person to person and makes each aspect of our lives slightly different. To me, perception is very important when it comes to ideas or issues. Perception allows each person to approach a certain situation or problem in a different way than another. This creates diversity and uniqueness. An example that this description depicts was a devastating storm I was involved in. This, of course, was a stressful environment. Certain people remained calm, others were anxious and distraught. By sensing this and making sense of this information, it allowed me to determine each individual’s current need because of perception. Perception helps determine why we do things, what we think, what we need, and ultimately provides different outlooks on life.     "
"Sensation and perception are related, but they are not the same thing. Sensation is what we experience or ""sense"" in our natural environment. This doesn't only include touching something, but also what we see, hear, and/or smell. On the other hand, perception is the way our brain interprets these sensations and turns it into something that makes sense to us. We should study these differences to learn more about how our brain processes information and why we perceive things the way that we do. When we misinterpret something, it's interesting to study why this is and find out how we can better perceive things in the future. "
"Sensation and perception are similar by allowing us to identify information, but they do differ in the way they process information. Our sensations are what stimulate us, and our perceptions happen when our brain processes and interprets for us. We study the differences because it helps us to better understand how our mind works. An example of our sensations is when our environment starts to feel warmer, everything starts blooming and turning green again. An example of our perception is when we perceive that spring is coming. Together they work to help our mind understand information, but separately the do their own part in the process. Our perceptions follow our sensations, because what we feel and see around us effects how we perceive our information."
"Sensation and perception are totally separate ideas and terms, but they go hand in hand to make sense of each other. Sensation is the information that is going into your brain that you are taking in through your senses (visual, auditory, taste, touch, smell). Perception is your interpretation of those sensations in the environment, it is how you understand them. There are a few reasons we study the difference between sensation and perception. One of them being is because we can sometimes get too little or too much information and are able to form different perceptions based on those amounts of sensations we receive. An example of this would be just like an illusion or magic trick like we did in the experiment with the rubber hand. Sometimes you are given multiple or not enough sensations, and then are able to form different perceptions based upon that information. With the rubber hand illusion, the persons touch and visual senses were being stimulated and were able to trick their brain into perceiving the rubber hand as their own. That's an example of being given too much stimulation to form a different perception. Another example of this is a magician tricking you into thinking they are levitating, because of the visual cues they are giving you when in reality you are not given enough senses to perceive it as not real, so you are then believing it is real. "
"Sensation and perception are very commonly confused concepts. We study them in order to properly distinguish the key differences and make comparisons. Sensation is a physical phenomenen which is registered in our brains by sensory organs. Perception on the other hand, is how the brain processes a sensation. An example would be smelling a flower. Two people can both smell a flower, this is an example of sensation. But ones perception of the flower may be a good smell while the others perception of the same exact smell may be bad. A good example of why it is important to study these concepts take place in a hospital setting. A patient who just got in a car accident may be hurt very badly, but does not have any pain at all. The patient is demanding to leave since he or she feels okay. The doctors job is to analyze the situation and inform the patient of his or her broken leg. The traumatic car accident had allowed the brain to perceive no physical pain until after the patient had been admitted into the hospital. A doctor who did not understand the concept of perception could have sent the patient home based purely off of the patients idea that he was okay."
"Sensation and perception are very interesting to study. Sensation is the raw input that is inputted into someone's brain, whereas perception is the interpretation of that data. I think that the most interesting thing about the two is that people can experience very similar sensations and have a completely different interpretation of it. I also think that it will be very difficult to fully understand perception for these same reasons that make it interesting."
"Sensation and perception often go hand in hand, but they are two very different roles. Sensation is anything that we hear, touch, taste, smell or see. Perception is how our brain interprets these senses. We study the differences between these things because sometimes its hard for us to perceive the things that we see, and this is interesting to cognitive psychologist. We know that sometimes we can trick our brain with illusions, and this is interesting because we can learn so much about our brain and how things are wired by taking a closer look at these illusion experiments. For example, in the rubber hand illusion, we learned that our brain will adopt foreign objects and make them their own. "
"Sensation and perception tend to get confused by some. We study the difference between sensation and perception basically because it is pretty important to know. Sensation is basically the information we send to our brains. Perception is then how our brain interprets that information, or how we perceive it. For example, if someone rings our doorbell, hearing the noise would be the sensation, while recognizing that it is the doorbell would be the perception. With this being said, it is easy to see why mixing up sensation and perception simply is not accurate. It is important to note that although they are not the same, sensation and perception do interact with each other. "
"Sensation is is the process by which our sensory receptors(eyes, ears, mouth, nose) receive and represent stimulus energies from our environment meaning the real world information.  Perception on the other hand is how the sensory information is organized and interpreted. The brain can make you interpret things in many different ways, sometimes different than the real world. The difference between the two of these types of information must be studied and one of those reasons being there can be many different perceptions all coming from the same sensation. Examples of this coming from the ear receptor could be hearing a sound, and the perception part of it is perceiving the music or sound that is being made. You can also see a light that would be an example but the color of the light can be perceived in many different ways. "
"Sensation is the ""response"" your body has to the exposure to a stimuli, such as smell, touch, hearing, taste, and sight. Perception would be the response to the sensation, that is occurring. These two items seem to be very similar, however they are very different, in that a sensation occurs first, and the perception is followed by the sensation. Perception is helped shaped by prior experiences, that an individuals have experienced. We study these differently because they are separate processes, sensation is something that occurs physically based on a stimuli that is presented to us via a sensory organ. Again, perception is something that is a reaction to those sensations. We study them differently, because if you touch a pan that has just come off the stove top, while most would sense that it is hot, they may not perceive that in the same amount of time. Even though they are sensing that the pan is hot, since perception is a different process, their reaction time my be different. "
"Sensation is the input of data into the sensory cortex. Perception is the interpretation of that data and the way that we build a mental picture of what is happening. We study the difference between the two because we can have multiple perceptions from the same sensation or we can have multiple sensations that lead to the same perception. Sensation has both too much information and too little information when trying to explain perception. An example would be looking at an abstract painting. Visually, the painting is one sensation, but it is possible to have more than one perception of what the painting is trying to portray. "
"Sensation is the processing of raw input into the system or the brain, where perception is the interpretation of the input into the system or the brain. This means that the sensation is was you are physically feeling such as the rubber hand illusion while we know that our hand is connected to us because we feel the sensation of the wood under our fingers and the brush on our fingers. It is our perception that changes with how we interpret our sensations and what we see such as the rubber hand test, we can no longer see our own hand and based on the sensation of the brush on our hand in correlation with the rubber hand, our perception recognized the rubber hand as our own."
"Sensation is what information your body takes in and reacts to. Perception is what you think your body has sensed. You can imagine the air your body has sensed is your air conditioning turning on because that is your perception of what you feel when you are actually sensing a breeze from the window you didn't know was open. We study the differences to better understand how we view what we are sensing and the information processing behind it."
"Sensation is when we use our senses, such as sight, smell, taste, sound, and touch, to in our environment. Perception is how we use these sensory clues to interpret our environment. We study the difference between sensation and perception because sensation is followed by perception. An example is when we're driving in our cars and approach a traffic light. If we see the traffic light goes from green to yellow to red, then our sensory organs, which would be our eyes, would sense these changes in color. Then, we interpret these changes in color by slowing down and stopping our cars, which would be our perception."
"Sensation:  a feeling or perception of a feeling on the body. Perception:  conscious experience that results from stimulation of the senses.  We study the difference between perception and sensation because they both involve each other, but are different. Perception involves dynamic processes that accompany and support our actions while sensations are feelings of our actions.  Perception has been considered the gateway to all other cognitions. Both have to deal with our senses and how we perceive those senses. "
"(1) We study the difference between sensation and perception because they have separate functions. Perception can be described as being the interpretations of what we see. Sensation can be described as being the input material and the perception is how you analyze and or perceive that material. Sensations are formed through touch, taste, sound, and smell.  I believe they are both studied because they both have to work together in order to produce cognition. Without one the other could not function."
"(4) Psychology in general started out as a philosophy. From there it progressed and developed more as years passed. The beginning of what we call now cognitive psychology started from the study of consciousness. During the 1830’s-1920’s Wilhelm Wundt and his student Edward Titchener began the study of metal activity, sensations, and feelings. William James studied the functions of specific mental activities. Cognitive science formed from the result of behaviorism. The new approach of cognitive psychology was not introduced as cognitive psychology until the late 1950’s and early 1960’s. The development of the computer introduced an explanation for cognitive psychology. Cognitive research started to be searched so that we could understand the thinking mind. The development of the computer made it possible to explain and compare mental functions that created behavior. "
"(5) Embodied cognition is a form of cognitive science that highlights the use of the environment within the development of cognitive process. Embodied cognition can also be expressed when other aspects of the body beyond the brain play a role within the cognitive process. An example of embodied cognition that interested me was when a baby develops the ability to control their arm muscles to reach a desired object. I never really thought of it that way until reading this particular article. A child learns to pick up an object by using their arm muscles. The same development can be used to pick up their own food and later on perform other tasks. The baby is using its body to explore the environment and at the same time using the environment to explore the different functions of their body. "
"(7) In my opinion the temporal lobe would be the worst to break. This would be considered the worst lobe to break because I would no longer be able to remember my loved ones. I would no longer be able to recognize and comprehend language through the Wernicke’s area. If the temporal lobe was damaged then visual memories would be impossible to remember. It would be very devastating to loose function of the temporal lobe because I would also no longer be able to hear family or friends communicate with me. "
"(9) We use cognitive maps in our everyday lives even when we don’t realize it. Whenever you drive somewhere and then drive back home you are using a survey cognitive map. You are using a mental representation of the route back to your home in order to arrive there. "
"(2) Bottleneck theory describes the ability to only perform one task at a time. The Bottleneck term occurs during a specific time in information processing where only one piece of information is being processed at a time. Performing two simple tasks at the same time may be very difficult. This is explained by the bottleneck theory. "
"short Attention is the process of enabling us to obtain some information for further processing and allow us to also set some aside.  Within attention there are two specific natures and roles. These consist of failures of selection and successes of selection. Each category has subcategories that go more into depth on each item. Failures of selection have a subcategory known as failures of selection in space. Within this there is a failure of change blindness. Change blindness is known as the failure of being able to detect change that has or is occurring during a scene. We focus our attention on a specific interest and forget to observe the rest of our surroundings. Another item within the failures of selection in space is known as endogenous attention. This is expressed as being a top-down process also known as being within your own knowledge. Endogenous attention is also known as controlled attention. You already have prior knowledge within you therefore you focus your attention on that specific interest avoiding any other surrounding that also results in change blindness. Posner’s paradigm shows that we tend to be very quick at naming targets when given a cued location. If there is not a cued location then we tend to be very slow. Posner’s paradigm uses endogenous attention to allow us to focus on a specific interest. Ultimately this results in us ignoring the rest of the visual field and focusing our attention on one interest.  "
"short Cognitive psychology is known as the study of the thinking mind. Cognition, also known as mental activity, is known as internal information that you have stored or transferred into memory. Cognitive psychology develops studies and experiments of mental activity so that we can have a better understanding of how the mind works. Mind-brain is known as the connection between the mind and the brain. The mind-brain has different levels of analysis that we use to describe information. The mind-brain is described as being a computer. It is made up of software and hardware that processes information on different levels. Although we cannot replace one level of analysis with another we are able to learn and gain insight from those other levels. I believe this is where experiments and artificial intelligence comes into play. We use the insight that we learn from the mental activities between the mind-brain to develop experiments that can ultimately result in different forms of artificial intelligence. With that being said all of this is known as cognitive psychology because it is the study of the thinking mind. The mind must be observed and studied in order to develop artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is known as the stimulation of the mind from using computers. Artificial intelligence is used to mimic the human brain.  Experiments must be conducted in order to understand how artificial intelligence can work and be helpful. Experiments are used to determine causal relationships between things. An experiment must have manipulated variables in order to be considered an experiment. Humans use the different levels of analysis within the mind-brain to process and interpret information. Artificial intelligence is used to mimic this process and transform it into a computer operated system. Instead of only humans having certain brain functions, through artificial intelligence now computers can do the same work that human brains originated."
"short Feature matching theory suggests that in order for us to recognize an object not all of the features have to be presents in order to do so. We use different stages of visual analysis to develop the missing characteristics of the objects. We can use top down processing and bottom up processing. Bottom up processing is a form of sensory information analysis that we retain from the world. Top down processing is a form of analysis that we actively seek from our own inner knowledge, beliefs, expectations, and goals. Bottom up processing can notice and recognize change when looking at objects but top down processing is needed to locate the desired the object. Word superiority is known as the manipulation of perception of a target letter based on the context of surrounding letters. We use top down processing to perceive the missing parts of the letters known as word superiority. Within word superiority we use the top down processing of our prior knowledge to conclude what the missing letters in the words are. Bottom up processing recognizes that there are letters or lines missing and the top down processing is used to identify what the letters are. "
"short The Mexican wave acts as the dendrites are in motion. The Mexican wave is a process of impulses created by the influx of positive ions. It is an action potential electrical impulse. Neurotransmitters are used to help the neurons with communication. Neurons communicate with one another by using neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters carry the information that is being transferred. They are released into the synapse where they bind to the receptor that it fits. The message that the neurotransmitter carries is transmitted to the receiving cell and carried to the cell nucleus. The Mexican wave is the movement process of the neurotransmitters. The Broca’s area is located within the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe carries out abstract thinking, attention, and speech production. The Broca’s area is known for speech production. The Mexican wave starts the movement of the neurotransmitters through the synapse to the receiving cell. The frontal lobe receives the message and the broca’s area delivers the production of the speech. "
"Skeptics and Luddites may want to have a pair of clean pants on hand because research for the sake of producing therapeutic applications produced amazing results. According to a 2014 article in the Huffington Post scientist achieved direct brain-to-brain communication. There is a fancy word used to describe direct brain-to-brain communication and that word is telapathy. I realize that the concept of telapathy may seem far fecthed and the word may conjure up images of Professor Xavier or Jean Grey or pant soiling fear, but scientist have discovered a method that makes brain-to-brain communication a possibility. That method involves the sender, with use of an EEC machine  sending a command via the internet to a receiver who is wearing a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil."
"Sometimes it can be hard to pay attention to all of the stuff happening around us. Because attention means focusing on some things while ignoring others, we might accidentally ignore important information. Failing to recognize this information is called change blindness. In one of my forensic classes, we talked about change blindness and its impact on eyewitness testimony. Even if we say ""I saw it with my own eyes"", we could have missed critical information or misinterpreted what we were seeing. Thus, paying attention may be more complicated than we imagined. One type of attention people are unaware of is orienting attention. Orienting attention can be endogenous, meaning it is controlled from top-down processes and is internal. The other is exogenous attention which is uncontrolled and from bottom-up processes. The differences between endogenous and exogenous attention are shown using the Posner cueing paradigm, which is a task examining attention orienting. "
"The brain is made up of neurons; which are just all the pieces that make up our brain. There are three different types of neurons: sensory, motor, and interneurons. Sensory neurons are activated by the sense organs like skin by touch or eyes for color. Motor neurons are activated by movement like muscles or ligaments. Interneurons are all the things that connect the first two kinds of neurons or basically everything else in between. The structure of a neuron can be very complicated with a lot of parts: first, Dendrites accept the message coming in, next it goes to the Cell Body, then the message is sent down the Axon by an action potential and it’s protected or “insulated” by the Myelin Sheath. The Action Potential is also known as The Mexican Wave which helps explain this inter-neuron communication; it takes the example of how a “wave” works at a sporting event and compares that to how an Action Potential through the neuron works. Action potentials are go/no go they just can’t half happen just like a wave at the sports game, once the wave starts it doesn’t stop until it goes all the way through the stadium or in the case of the Action Potential; all the way through neuron.  The message then ends up at the Action Terminals or Terminal Buttons where it gets sent on to the next neuron. Other parts of the neuron not included in the actual Action Potential are Glial Cells which is the neurons support system, they are located between neurons and help with cell processing. Then there are Receptors which are located on the Dendrites and help with information processing. There are also Neurotransmitters which are chemicals that help send the message through the synapse; which is the space between neurons. Some examples of neurotransmitters are serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. On a bit bigger scale which all these millions of neurons make up is the brain, the brain is sectioned into lobes and each lobe in responsible for different things. There is the Frontal Lobes, the Parietal Lobes, the Occipital Lobes, and the Temporal Lobes. The Frontal Lobes contains the Primary Motor Cortex which is involved in abstract thinking and controls muscle movements, the Prefrontal Cortex which is involved in attention, and the Broca’s area is linked to speech production.  The Parietal Lobes contain the Primary Somatosensory Area which is involved in taste and balance. The Parietal Lobes are also involved in spatial processing and memory management like search and retrieval and storage. The Occipital Lobes are involved with all things visual; seeing and attention. The Temporal Lobes are involved with all things hearing; including face recognition and memory."
"Attention can be a difficult word to define, it means different things to different people. Attention can either enhance or inhibit information. Paying attention to something can help you learn more about it and process it on a deeper level. Not paying attention to something you learn nothing further about it and it basically just gets put to the side. When we fail to pay attention to information we can miss a lot of things. When you are at a concert, a party, a sports game there is a lot information you have to take in to process the whole situation and you can experience failures of selection. An example of having a failure of selection is change blindness; which is missing a big change in the visual field. We selectively attend to information in our visual field and we ignore the rest. So being in that busy of an environment you focus on the important things and have to leave out some information. Or when you are at events like these you need to look for your friend wearing a pink shirt, you have to look and pick through the crowd for the color pink, this is called endogenous attention. This involves a voluntary aspect and originates from within or from your own knowledge; you know your friend is wearing pink and you know she’s going to be in a specific area of the stadium, house, or crowd. Attention can be directed away from the task at hand by noticeable and powerful stimuli and this is called exogenous attention. Like the sound of a gun being shot, can provide an exogenous cue and can help you protect yourself and others. There has been a lot of experiments and studying of visual attention and a good example of this is Posner’s Cueing Paradigm; which been used to measure manual and eye-movement reaction times to target stimuli in order to investigate the effects of concealed positions of attention in response to different cue conditions. "
"Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind. Cognition was a reaction to behaviorism and during this cognitive revolution came about the idea of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This idea was proposed by Alan Newell and Herbert A. Simon, they developed the BINAC: the Binary Automatic Computer; they wanted to use computers to simulate the human mind. That made people ask the question of the mind-brain connection: are the mind and the brain really separate or are they intertwined? There are two levels of analysis there is the physiological side- the neurons/brain and the mental side- the thinking/mind. The brain helps understand what is going on and the mind is emergent from brain processes. How do we test thinking and prove these concepts? Experiments! Experiments are looking for causal (X causes Y) relationships between things. To make a relationship causal you have to manipulate variables; there independent variables which manipulated by the experimenter, there are dependent variables which are measured factors, and there are extraneous variables or 3rd variable which is things that can change or interfere with the outcome. Cognitive psychology is a science, which is tested through experiments. "
"Word superiority, top down processing, bottom up processing, feature matching theory: Our brains process information two different ways: top down processing and bottom up processing. Top down processing is general to the specific and knowledge driven; we form our perceptions starting with a larger object, concept, or idea before working our way toward more detailed information. Bottom up processing is the specific to general and data driven; the opposite of top down. An example of top down processing is the word superiority effect, this when words are scrambled and as long as the first and last letter of the word are the same we can still read it. An example of bottom up processing is feature matching theory; we search for simple but characteristic features of an object and their presence signal a match to the model. Processing information in the brain is happening at the same time and is happening in different neural areas. Neurons show selectivity to parts that are similar to the model."
"sorrell Cognitive psychology came about as a reaction to behaviorism. Behaviorism could not explain language and failed to provide insights into how perception worked. The birth of cognitive science came at the 1957 MIT symposium; which in turn was directly tied to the development of the computer. The military pushed for it and were the largest buyers of cognition research and Miller’s Magic Number (1956) was a turning point into switching from behaviorism to cognition. It said that 7 + or – 2 is how much the average person could remember. Cognitive psychology is science which is tested through experiments and is involved in many different people’s research; business, military, computers and advertising. "
"sorrell Embodied cognition is when you imagine doing something and your brain reads it the same as actually doing it. For example the Fitt’s Law experiment we did with the boxes and the lines. We first did the task and then imagined doing the task and it took around the same amount of time even though we could of imagined doing it as fast as we wanted."
"sorrell I think the worst lobe to break would be the occipital lobe. I know that it only involves vision. But to me vision is the most important of all the sensing/perceiving organs. My whole life revolves around me being able to see. My relationships, my friends, my goals and dreams, they all can’t happen if I don’t have vision. It would change every aspect of my life and would take a lot getting used to. "
"sorrell I thought the Turning Test experiment was pretty interesting. The Turing Test involved round of Q&A, both rounds were the same questions and one set of answers was a real person and the other set was from a computer. And based on the answers we had to pick which one we thought was which. 77% of us got it right thinking the first round of answers were human and that of course left 23% of us guessing wrong. The IV was which option was human and which option was the computer and the DV is which one we guessed."
"sorrell Illusions are false or misleading perceptions. The Hollow Face Illusion is one we discussed in class, which is a misinterpreted depth cue. A “hollow face” that is pointing away from you looks like it’s pointing towards you. If you walk around a room and watch the stationary mask, the head turns! Or at least it looks that way. The face appears to follow you wherever you travel."
"sorrell Some people think sensation and perception are the same, but they are not. Sensation is the sensing of our environment through touch, taste, sight, sound, and smell.  This information is sent to our brains in raw form where perception comes into play.  Perception is the way we interpret these sensations and therefore make sense of everything around us. Some examples of sensation vs perception: Sensing the warmth of a fire vs. perceiving being near the fire, sensing the wind vs. perceiving the fan blowing on you, sensing the cold weather vs. perceiving it is winter."
"Studying sensation in a way that doesn’t distinguish it from perception and vice versa inhibits a full understanding. While the two processes are intertwined with one another, there are clear differences. Sensation involves the gathering of information by sensory organs (eyes, nose, ears, skin, taste buds, etc.), which is encoded into the brain. After sensation occurs, the brain takes that input information and makes sense of it, creating a seemingly logical reality in the process. During perception, the mind takes into account the context of the situation and past memories so that the raw information from the sensory organs has more meaning than just light waves, sound waves, pressure and temperature, and chemicals. For example, a person might be at the musical Les Misérables watching the actors on stage engage in an intense gun fight while singing and dancing. The eyes see the battle and bloodshed, and the ears hear the (sometimes) pleasant singing and exclamations of the actors. Sensation is taking place: the person is seeing and hearing real events thanks to his or her sensory organs. However, sensation isn’t enough for that person to fully know what is going on. Perception helps to make that sensory information more understandable. Without the brain’s ability to perceive what could possibly be going on, the musical would just be a loud, visually overwhelming, indoor gun fight. Sensation and perception are interconnected processes, but they each revolve around different responsibilities of the brain and body, and neither makes logical sense on its own. By studying the unique roles of sensation and perception, we are able to understand each process more thoroughly, which also increases the understanding of the cognitive process as a whole."
"Studying the difference between sensation and perception is important because both of these processes have a direct influence onto how humans see the world. Sensation is various stimuli that enters our system while perception is how we make sense of the stimuli. Knowing the difference between the two helps us understand how each process impacts people and gives us insight into how people are affected when either of these processes fail. For example, when people experience a loss of sensation, we can understand how this impacts their perception of the world around them."
"Technology has come a very long way in the study of cognitive psychology. One type of brain research that has interested me is the recording the brain. An EEG machine records electrical activity in the brain. When a certain part of the brain becomes active, it draws more blood and radioactivity to it. The EEG machine process the information from the brain and even produce 3D images from it."
"The actual idea of cognitive psychology did not start as a topic itself, it actually started as a philosophy. Which is weird to think about, most of the information we know of psychology stems from that root of philosophy. Researchers were interested in why we do the things we do and how those things work, when you cannot physically see those things. Then later on Wilhelm Wundt, known to be the father of psychology, came up with this idea of the mental consciousness in the brain to try to make better sense of how the brain was able to do and make us think and act the way we do through introspect. After this idea, they wanted something that would be measurable to work with and experiment with and they believed things like this that you cannot see are not able to be measured so this was the start of the idea of behaviorism. Then this idea came back to that we cannot have behaviors that are measurable if we don't have perception internally on how our thoughts and processes work to create those behaviors, thus cognitive psychology science began being researched. "
"The aftereffects illusion is a color illusion that breaks us at the sensory level in order to get us to perceive something that isn’t really there. It has us stare at an image with specific colors like green and yellow, getting our cones to continually fire telling us those colors. Then when that image is replaced with a blank one, our cones no longer see those colors and they go in the opposite direction to tell us red and blue respectively even though nothing is really there."
"The brain is organized into four main lobes: the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal. Fittingly, the frontal lobe is at the front end of the brain, behind and above the forehead. It is mainly comprised of three major areas, each with important and specific responsibilities that allow a human to be an advanced species. The primary motor cortex is located at the back end of the frontal lobe and allows for intricate motor movements like writing or typing; the prefrontal cortex is in the anterior region of the frontal lobe and is responsible for abstract thinking, planning, logic, reasoning, personality development, some emotions, and memories tied to each of those responsibilities; finally, a specific spot in the left region of the frontal lobe (or the left and right for left-handed individuals) called Broca’s area is chiefly in charge of speech production in response to what another person has said. For all of these areas in the frontal lobe (as well as the various areas in the rest of the lobes of the brain) to do their jobs, an intricate communication process must occur between the multitude of brain cells, or neurons. This message transmission process is sometimes referred to as “The Mexican Wave” because of the electrical, wave-like activity that occurs as neurons communicate with one another. If Broca’s area needs to send a message to relevant neurons so a person can respond logically to a friend’s question (e.g., “What did you have for lunch today?”), an electrochemical process needs to occur. This process happens fully or not at, which is why it is called an ‘all-or-none’ response. First, the message receivers of a neuron called dendrites receive a message via neurotransmitters from the previous cell. Neurotransmitters represent the “chemical” part of the electrochemical process because that’s exactly what they are. These chemicals, like epinephrine (adrenaline), endorphins, and dopamine, represent a way for specific messages to be passed on from neuron to neuron. Once neurotransmitters are sent across the synaptic cleft to receptors on another cell, they will cause an action potential to occur which excites the neuron. The electrical impulse moves from the dendrite to the rest of the cell, and “The Mexican Wave” analogy starts to make sense. This wave of energy moves through the cell body into the axon, which is like a highway for the message. Once it reaches the axon terminals at the end of the neuron, this process repeats as the message moves to the dendrites of other cells. As intricate as this whole event is, it occurs extremely fast. After a friend asks, “What did you have for lunch today?,” Broca’s area’s job is to interpret that message and figure out a logical response, such as, “I had a salad and sandwich.” In the blink of an eye, the neurotransmitters and action potentials tell Broca’s area what was heard and what to say, and the electrical impulses that move throughout the brain allow the person to vocally respond with an answer."
"The brain itself has been thought to be extremely complex in terms of how it functions and how it makes you, you. This idea is what brought cognitive psychology to life which is studied and tested through experiments. Cognitive psychology started as a philosophy and then eventually became it’s own separate concept of the mental processes that people are able to produce. An idea that emerged from cognitive psychology is the “mind brain”, which is can be explained or questioned as; is the brain there to make all the neurological physical processes, or is it there serving as a way of mental functioning as well, or is it both? People tend to argue over this and say if there is no physical processes being made at any point there is no longer any mental functioning happening, which would go along with that the mind brain is together as a whole to function, not separate, which can bring up many ethical issues. Artificial intelligence has also experimented because the idea of a computer simulated model being able to function and have mental processes have been a scary thought. However, it would not possible for artificial intelligence to have the capability to take on ALL of the mental processes and functions of a human. I believe that they are separate in the sense that their “brain” or hardware is separate than it’s software. Computers have no way in being able to emotions or mental processing fully, it has only gotten close."
"The Broca's area in the brain is located within the frontal lobe.  These two areas play major roles in virtually all aspects of our lives.  For example, within the broca's area are many neurotransmitters which can begin vibrating, and then cause other neurotransmitters in the brain to vibrate as well, thus causing the phenomenon of the The Mexican Wave to occur.  "
"The Broca’s area is responsible for language, and motor functions related to speech; which is located in the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is one of the four main lobes in the brain; which is responsible for movement, problem solving, and planning. Neurons in the brain communicate by the Mexican wave and neurotransmitters. The Mexican wave is when brain cells are communicating within each other, and sending out vibrations that other cells catch onto and start vibrating in a similar fashion. Neurotransmitters communicate between cells, and help convey the nerve impulses."
"The color illusion is one of the illusions we discussed in class. An example of this illusion can be the dress that everybody was hype about whether it was gold or white or blue or black. First people were basically ignored the blue so you can see the gold or ignoring the gold to see the blue and black. In this illusion the brain basically figures out which color light is attracting off the dress your looking at by disregarding that particular color from the real color of the dress."
"The concept of attention is the process of focusing your sensory field on one particular source of information for increased comprehension. There are several forms of attention that are driven by different processes of the brain. For example, endogenous attention is a top bottom process controlled by context. To demonstrate the difference between attention processes, researchers use Posner’s cueing paradigm. Posner’s cueing paradigm demonstrates how exogenous attention can lead to a faster identification of a targets and how miscuing endogenous attention will lead to missed targets. The idea of focusing your attention on a source of information makes it seem like missing information would be unlikely. Unfortunately, it happens quite often, the failure to notice a change in your perceptual field in called change blindness.  "
"The correlational brain research is a type we studied. Correlational research consists of no direct manipulation of variables, and unfortunately is not very reliable because of this. The lack of controls and independent variables makes us unable to come to conclusions about what we are studying. Other cons with this are that because everyone is different in some way, a correlation of two variables in the sample may be because of totally different reasons, hence why the lack of independent variables and controls is so important. An example of this is video games and violence. It has been shown that there is a positive correlation between the time spent playing violent video games, and violent acts committed by the players. This does not necessarily mean that the violence is caused by the video games, it could be for a totally different reason. Correlational research still exists because we are sometimes unable to ethically manipulate a variable such as video game playing, to measure the amount of violent outbursts. So we look at patterns."
"The development of the computer is thought to have started the cognitive revolution. The computer worked much like a human mind in the way it processed information. When it was evident that the brain could work similarly and information processing could be broken down into smaller steps it lead to experiments studying thinking, which is cognitive pyschology."
"The difference between sensation and perception is studied due to their inter-related processes. Sensation is considered the information processed by sensory receptors, which include ears, eyes, tongue, etc., whereas perception is the interpretation of that information that was processed by the sensory receptors. In short, the information being processed by sensory receptors may produce multiple and different perceptions. An example to describe their relationship would be the famous vases and faces diagram, which is a figure and ground perception. Looking at the diagram and viewing the physical aspect of it requires using only one of the senses (sight/eyes) to be able to see the diagram. However, one is able to have more than one perception of the diagram. Looking at the main part of interest of the diagram (forerground), one can perceive a figure, which are the two faces. If you were to pay attention to the background (or the rest of the diagram), one would perceive a vase. "
"The difference between sensation and perception is very distinct, yet complementary. Sensation can be defined as the process of the body taking in information and creating impulses that are sent to our brains to interpret the information passed on by the sensory organs. The information that is processed by the sensory organs can be either passive or active, meaning that we don't actually have to be conscious in order for our bodies to pick up sensory information.  Our perception is entirely active. This is when our brains receive the information from the sensory organs, break down, analyze, and interpret what that information means. We study the difference because researchers want to know which processes do what, in what order, and gain a better understanding on how the bodies senses break down information and interact with our brains. An example, of a sensation-perception relationship would be to smell a flower. The body will sense the odor given off by the flower, process that information and break it down into neural impulses. Those impulses are then sent to the brain and interpreted and give us our on perception of to what we are smelling and to what it actually is. They are two entirely different, yet complementary processes. "
"The difference of sensation and perception is studied because of their interaction. For example, if one is able to understand their differences and the context in which they function, it can be determined how they work together. "
"The differences between sensation and perception are studied to understand different responses and brain processes.  Such as with the rubber hands illusion, the participants perceived the rubber hand as their own due to the effects of sensation.  When senses are involved, the brain can perceive something different than what it is.  For an example, the other weekend, I went outside my house and noticed what looked like smoke rolling out from over the porch.  While exploring where the smoke was coming from, my heart rate increased and I began to notice a fight or flight response from my body.  After realizing the smoke like substance was only steam from the sun on the roof, I knew there was no danger, though I had to calm myself much as I would after an emergency event.  The visual sensation caused my perception to influence my body in a way different than the actual situation.  Therefore sensation and perception are different due to cause and effect responses. "
"The Ebbinghause size illusion had different size circles shown, and you had to decide which circle looked bigger. This illusion is a size/consistency illusion. The perceptual process that occurs in this illusion is if the background images are the same angle but different distances, our brain assumes that the image in the background is larger. If you move an object further into the background, their visual angle gets smaller but also the position of the horizon in the picture changes. Therefore, you think that the backround image is smaller, when in reality, both images are the same size."
"The example of color illusion was the most intriguing and fun illusion, in my opinion. With color illusions, the on-off and off-on cells cause perceptual process to be broken. Light enters the eye and activates photoreceptors. The receptive field of the on-off cells consist of an inner area and an outer surrounding area. For on-off cells, the inner area will determine whether a color is present or absent. Off-on cells positively identify a color from the surrounding outer area. For example, the inner area recognizes the color green. Green is positively identified, so the cells are excitatory. However, if the inner area does not recognize the color green, the cells are inhibitory, meaning that the color red must be present. Vice versa, in the off-on cells, the color green is now negatively identified, while red is positively identified. The outer surrounding area positively identifies red. The inner area negatively identifies green. So if red is absent, this must mean that the inhibitory color green is the color present. The color illusion is caused from fatigue of these cells. For instance, in the illusion involving the flag that was discussed in class, as the on-off cells are continually firing (focusing on the specific colors of the flag), they reach a threshold (changing the screen to white) causing the on-off cells to stop firing, resulting in an after image of the inverse off-on cell colors (opposite flag colors seen on white page). The on-off cells and off-on cells are related to each other and are antagonistic of one another, which explains the broken perceptual process."
"The example that illusion we discussed in class would be the perception where they linear perspective is broken in this visual illusion. An example is the use of light and darkness that brings my Thomas Kinkade painting to life with a 3-dimensional effect. If I could not see the 3-d effect I would be having problems with my rods and cones."
"The field of cognitive psychology began at the 1957 MIT symposium. Cognitive psychology began being researched as a way to describe the thoughts behind our behaviors and as a way to expand on the inherent limitations of behaviorist principles."
"The field of cognitive psychology had an early start in the study of philosophy, but only as an aspect of the field. The first scientific studies were performed by Wilhelm Wundt in Germany. Wundt’s research focused on the associations of words and introspection. The work of Wundt was later expanded to include sensation by his student Titchener. The research performed by Wundt and Titchener focused heavily on introspection but provided a foundation for the development of functionalism. Functionalism was developed by William James in response to the shortcomings of Wundt’s work. The research of James studied the different functions underlying cognition. The work of James was followed by the study of behaviorism. A psychologist named Skinner developed the field of behaviorism and used the concepts to explain many aspects of human behavior. Unfortunately, Skinner disregarded other aspects of psychology which led to push back from Chomsky. The work of Chomsky led to the ideas that would aid in the development of cognitive psychology. Then in the late 50s, the creation of the first computers forever changed the field of cognitive psychology as scientist began to relate many aspects of human cognition to the underlying fundamentals of computer processes."
"The front of the brain is known as the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for many things, such as abstract thinking, memory, personality, and so on. One specific part of the frontal lobe is known as Broca's area. This area is important because it controls speech production, and therefore, damage to this area causes issues with one's speech. This is because cells that are needed to produce speech are killed when the brain trauma occurs. A neuron is a cell that sends and receives signals in our bodies. A neuron has a couple of different processes of communication. The chemical form of communication are our neurotransmitters. These chemicals allow signals to go from neuron to neuron. The second form of communication is the electrical process. The electrical process our neurons go through is known as its action potential, or the Mexican Wave. This is because an electrical impulse occurs which sends the information down the axon. If the brain experiences damage, its ability to send and receive certain impulses may be impacted. "
"The frontal lobe is  the section of the brain at the very front. Right behind the fore-head.. The frontal lobe is associated with reward, attention, short-term memory, and decision making skills. This lobe also includes most of the dopamine sensitive neurons. A smaller portion of the frontal -lobe is known as Broca's area which is responsible for language processing. Both of these areas can not function without their neuro transmitters which are the chemical substances that release at the end of a nerve fiber. All of these terms are just fragmants of what make up our entire brain structure. "
"The frontal lobe is a huge section of the brain located near the front of your brain (forehead area), that controls many different functions. A few of them are your personality and emotions, as well as part of your speech center. This speech center that is very important for speech production is called broca’s area. This area is typically located on the left hemisphere of the brain and it is what helps you formulate or produce speech to be able to form words and have them flow out of your speech. This all happens very quickly and can be explained by neurons firing with this idea of the Mexican wave, which is just a fun way of explaining how information is being transmitted from dendrites, to axons, to synapses, to receptor sites, while a neurotransmitter is transmitting that information on to the next neuron. That information is being transmitted just like it would if you were at a soccer game throwing your hands up in the air for “the wave” game. Once the wave gets to your part of the section you’re sitting in, you throw your hands up just like that neurotransmitter has sent the message onward to the next neuron through an electro-chemical process."
"The frontal lobe is a main lobe located in the front of the brain.  This lobe contains the primary motor cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and Broca's area.  The frontal lobe is responsible for abstract, in-depth thinking, attention, and the production of speech.  Broca's area in the frontal lobe is the area of our brain that aids in the production of speech.  Damage to Broca's area in the frontal cortex leads to difficulty expressing speech and sometimes difficulty expressing oneself through writing. Although damage to this area can hinder speech production, the understanding of language remains intact.  Within the frontal lobe and throughout our brain there are tiny neurotrasmitters, which allow our brain cells to communicate with one another.  Neurotransmitters deal specifically with communication between cells in the brain, while the Mexican Wave can describe communication within our brain cells.  The process of communication within the cells to transfer a message is called action potential.  This is because communication within the cell can either be transferred to the next cell or die off, depending on the importance of the information.  "
"The frontal lobe is a major part of the brain and is located at the front of the brain, a dominant area of the frontal lobe of the brain is the Broca's area. The broca's area controls many functions involving speech. The frontal lobe contains many neurons, Neurons release neurotransmitters, these are chemical substances that relay information from one cell to another cell. One of the main neurotransmitters that is released from the frontal lobe part of the brain is dopamine. Sometimes certain information sent from one neurotransmitter to another neuron can activate that neuron to imitate a certain action, when this happens it is basically creating a Mexican Wave inside the brain. The Mexican Wave is a type of inter neuron communication along with the neurotransmitters."
"The frontal lobe is a portion of the cerebral cortex that is attached to the brain stem. There are many tinier parts to this lobe, one of them being the Broca's area. This part of the frontal lobe is in control of how you respond with speech. Broca's area, like all of the cerebral cortex, is comprised of neurons that communicate with each other via a process nicknamed the Mexican Wave. In this intra-neuron communication, information is sent through a neuron as electricity. When this information reaches terminal buttons, it may be sent to another neuron. The Axon terminals send neurotransmitters (as chemicals) into the synapse to communicate with another neuron. These neurotransmitters transmit information from neuron to neuron as a part of the Mexican wave process."
"The Frontal Lobe is a very important part of the brain. This part is in the front where the forehead is and houses other parts such as primary motor cortex and prefrontal cortex that helps with abstract thinking and attention, while the Broca’s area is what you are wanting to say when you are being spoken to. This is where speech production occurs. In order to communicate you have to have the neurotransmitters which help to send messages if there is enough information in the brain to send, or it can not send the message. The Mexican wave is like a group of people at a football game doing the wave, sending a (wave) information across the stands, is very similar to how the messages get passed in the brain."
"The Frontal lobe is an area in brain in frontal part. This lobe handles behaviors and mental activities. As well as, information store in memory in planning and reasoning. This helps in Broca's area in helping assist in speech. The Broca's area is located just behind the frontal lobe. This area helps the actual production of language. This works very close with the frontal lobe. As we move small to the neurotransmitter they are located in the front of th axon. The neurotransmitter are like what they sound transmitter that run across the structure of an neuron. The role is major they depend on receptors and the beginning and end of the axon for deliver of their message. The whole action potiental process is known as the Mexican Wave were there are inter neurons are the whole action potential working together to be able to produce a successful action potential. This process includes dendrites to the neurotransmitters then the excitatory post action and the summation. This process does not always work properly but it happens so fast the body or the human does not know it didn't work properly once. "
"The frontal lobe is an area of the brain that controls motor function as well as abstract thoughts. This lobe also contains Broca's area which is related to speech production. These areas, as well as any other area are controlled by electrical impulses and chemical impulses. The electrical impulses being the action potential that travels down the axon of the neurons throughout our body. These action potentials, also known as the ""Mexican wave"" are all or none. This means that if they have a stimulus that matches or surpasses the neuron's threshold it will result in a response. Often times this response can result in that neuron sending a chemical message called a neurotransmitter through the synapse on to the next neuron."
"The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain and is responsible for managing many behavioral and mental activities. Some functions that the frontal lobe controls include: abstract thinking, attention, muscle movements, attention based systems, speech, and more. The frontal lobe can be broken down into different areas: the primary motor cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and the Broca's. These different areas together are what make up the frontal lobe and each have their own function(s). Focusing on the Broca's, it is only located on the left side of the frontal lobe, assuming the individual is right-handed; however, it can be on both sides or only on the right side of the frontal lobe if the individual is left-handed. This area of the brain is responsible for computing speech and interpreting sounds. When speech is being produced, the body turns those sound waves into vibrations then into electrical impulses (or action potentials), which are caused by an influx of positive ions from ion channels. Once the speech is converted into action potentials, the peripheral nervous system sends that message via the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system, which consist of the brain and spinal cord. The Broca's is a part of the brain, so the message being sent via the peripheral nervous system was to the Broca's in order for this area of the brain to ultimately formulate a response to what is being heard. In order to understand how the signal was sent via the peripheral nervous system, one must take a closer look at the chemical components. A neurotransmitter is a chemical substance, such as dopamine and epinephrine, that is released by a neuron and picked up by another neuron with the cycle continuing until it has sent the message to where it is needed. When the speech was converted to an action potential, this signaled an electro-chemical process involving sensory neurons. One must first understand the structure of the neuron to be able to understand how they communicate with each other. The structure of the neuron consists of the dendrites, which receives messages from other neurons, the cell body, which supports the life of the neuron, the axon, which communicates the message from the cell body to the axon terminals, myelin, which are sheaths of fat that cover parts of the axon and help to send neural messages more quickly, and the axon terminals, which sends the message to the next neural cell. When an electrical signal is formed by the body from speech, the neurons within the ear pick the signal up via the dendrites. The electrical signal will only persist if it reaches threshold, which is the minimum level needed in order for it to generate an action potential. Once the signal is picked up by the dendrites and is strong enough to generate an action potential, the signal continues down the axon to the axon terminals, where neurotransmitters are released into a synapse. The synapse is a spacial area between neurotransmitters where the axon terminals of one neuron meet the dendrites of another. Within the synapse, neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal and are picked up by the dendrites of the other neural cell. Also known as an action potential, this inter-neuron communication is what some call the Mexican Wave. "
"The frontal lobe is responsible for managing behaviors for the body and mental activities of the brain. It holds the primary motor cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and Broca's area. The primary motor cortex is what helps us produce fine motor movements such as typing on a computer. The Broca's area is responsible for speech production without this area it would be impossible for us to be able to speak. However, to be able to speak or do fine motor movements, neurons must be activated to tell our brain what our body needs to do. This inter-neuron communication or action potential can be described by the Mexican Wave. The Mexican Wave is a way of describing how a neuron receives and then fires a message. Dendrites receive messages from a neurotransmitter, which are the chemicals messengers between neurons. The neurotransmitter creates an electrical impulse that radiates down the dendrite then through the axon of a neuron. The impulse then reaches the axon terminals and is released as a neurotransmitter into the synapse. The neurotransmitter then binds to a receptor it specifically fits to transfer the message further."
"The frontal lobe is responsible to abstract thinking, attention, and speech. Located within in the frontal lobe, Broca's area is involved in action recognition and production. When the conditions for an action potential are met, neurotransmitters (chemicals released by the neuron that transmit signals) are released and axons move along similar to the movement of a Mexican wave at a sporting event. "
"The frontal lobe is the part of the brain that contains 3 main sectionings of the prefrontal cortext, primary motor cortext and the Broca's area. As each of these make up the frontal lobe, this lobe deals with abstract thinking, attention, and speech production. The Broca's area is located in the frontal lobe that is associated with communication of speech and language. Each lobe of the brain consists of a group of neurons that all do different specific things. In order for the frontal lobe and Broca's area to work the neurons need to be able to send and receive those signals for function which are conducted by neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemicals in the brain released from neurons that send messages to other neurons for functioning. The Mexican Wave can be identified as neurons taking on the vibrations of other inhibitory neurons. The Mexican Wave is the relay and continuation of vibrations that addresses cognitive function in the brain, specially the frontal lobe in the Broca's area. If this natural pulse from neurotransmitters from neuron to neuron, The Mexican Wave, is interrupted, it can cause a great deal of damage in the Broca's area of the frontal lobe."
"The frontal lobe is the worst lobe to break.  The frontal lobe is responsible for many different functions such as judgment, language, motor function, and problem solving, and these are just a few of the many things that the frontal lobe can do.  Damage to any part of the frontal lobe could drastically alter a person's life.  Once simple tasks like sentence formation and even walking could be lost forever.  For example, a person may be excel in their career in mathematics, a field that involves a lot of problem solving.  If they suffer an injury to their frontal lobe, however, their problem solving abilities may be lost thus ending their career.  This example can be applied to virtually any aspect of a person's life after suffering from a frontal lobe break. "
"The frontal lobe of our brains is the part of our brains that is responsible for our behaviors and decision making in our day-to-day lives. Broca's area is a part of the frontal lobe that is responsible for being able to interpret speech and is important in our usage of communication. Neurotransmitters are the messengers within the brain, they send information throughout the brain. Messages are sent down the length of the neuron and can be slower or faster depending on the neurotransmitter itself. The Mexican Wave was more or less an interpretive dance that showed how messages travel down the length of a neurotransmitter, it was a more visual way of understanding the functions of a neurotransmitter. "
"The frontal lobe would be the worst in my opinion, because not only is it the largest lobe of the brain, it also carries out a lot of our cognitive function and motor functioning. If your frontal lobe was damaged to the point it was rendered useless, you would not longer be able to communicate, nor would you be able to cognitively solve problems. You could no longer express emotion, and you wouldn't have any functioning motor skills. These among many other things, is enough reason to want to keep your frontal lobe intact."
"The frontal lobe would be the worst lobe to break. This lobe of the brain is responsible for tasks such as producing speech, controlling body movement, and storing information used to assist us with reasoning and making decisions. The primary motor cortex is also part of the frontal lobes and is responsible for fine motor movements. Communication is very important to me and I don't know what I would do if I lost this lobe of my brain. An example of this is if I were to suffer a brain injury and I broke this lobe, I wouldn't be able to communicate with my friends or family. I may be able to hear what is being said, but without the use of the Broca's area, found in the frontal lobe, I wouldn't be able to produce speech to communicate."
"The frontal lobe would be the worst one to break. The frontal lobe controls voluntary movement and would therefore leave someone immobile if it were damaged. Speech would suffer greatly if the frontal lobe were to be damaged. I would not even be capable of typing my answer for this exam due to my fine motor movements being diminished. My personality, emotions, and even my memory would suffer from damage to my frontal lobe."
"The gardener dragon illusion is one of the illusions that we talked about in class. As one moves around in front of the dragon, it appears that the dragon’s head follows. This is an example of a depth cue illusion called the hollow face illusion. We anticipate that faces come out towards us rather than cave away from us, so we perceive the depth cue incorrectly."
"The Garner Dragon illusion is a hollow face illusion.  It is a misinterpreted depth illusion.  This illusion tricks our brain into thinking the dragon's head is turning and following us as we move around the room, when it reality the dragon is very still.  The way the dragon is folded tricks our depth processing and makes the dragon seem to be watching us.  "
"The illusion I would like to use as my example is the Muller-Lyer illusion. This is a really popular optical illusion and is often the ""go to"" example for most. While researching, I found that there is dispute about the perceptual process behind this illusion. The answer I agree with the most is that those looking at the lines are interpreting the image wrong. The name for this hypothesis is the linear-perspective hypothesis. I understand this to mean that when we look at these arrows, we look at them as if they are actually three-dimensional corners. This is why a lot of professors will physically draw a house shaped object out of the arrows to show why people are seeing what they are. So, basically, we are perceiving the size of the lines incorrectly. "
"The illusion that stuck with me that we discussed was Gardner's Dragon. This example of the hollow face illusion breaks the perceptual process of our assumptions of how faces are structured. Since it is, in fact, hollow, our mind fills in the gap and shows us a whole, normally structured face, even though it is in fact concaved in. "
"The importance of studying sensation and perception lies in the fast that they seem so similar, and are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. Sensation is dealing with the signals you are bringing into the brain and the perception is what picture you make with those signals. This is seen with illusions quite often. The sensation is showing the same picture for everyone, but they can be depicted as totally different things due to the person’s perception."
"The inverted faces illusion is an illusion that breaks top-down processing. What we believe to be correct is part of top-down processing so when we are subjected to this illusion we perceive the distorted image or upside image of a familiar object as being correct or a match. However when the image is inverted we discover that the inverted image and the upright image are not similar."
"The lilac chaser is an optical illusion that is both a motion and color illusion. This illusion deals with afterimage effects where a complementary color replaces the original color whenever it disappears. Since the colors disappear in a circular order, it also looks like there is a circular motion with a dot in the picture."
"The lobe I believe would be the worst to break is the frontal lobe.  Since the frontal lobe is associated with some motor activity, speech and thinking, I believe it is one of the most important parts of our brain.  More than any of those, I do not want to lose the ability to have emotion and process information maturely.  "
"the lobes of the brain all work together so it is difficult to pick which lobe would be the worst to break. The occipital lobe is important for Vision. The temporal lobes are important for visual memories. Parietal lobes are important for sensations(touch,taste). Lastly, the frontal lobe is important for voluntary movements and cognitive functioning. For me, I think the worst one to ""break"" would be the frontal lobe. I want to be able to voluntarily move and it's also an important part of the brain for speech, reasoning and decision making. All of these functions are important in my daily life making the frontal lobe the ""worst one to break"". "
"The main concept of this question is attention. Attention means to focus on someone or something that is interesting or fascinating. When we look at change blindness, some of our attention may get distracted and we won't notice something has changed. Change blindness is when there is a change but we fail to notice what is different. When we are in this type of situation, we are highly focused on trying to find the changes. Because we are so focused on one thing, we are using endogenous attention/controlled attention. This type of attention is when you have knowledge of something and you relate everything around you to that information to try and find the matter or object. You might use these types of attention if you were given the Posner's cueing paradigm test. This type of test assesses a person's ability to perform an attentional shift and to see how well you focus. "
"The Meuller-Lyer illusion displays images of three arrows which have the same length line in the center, but the first has two outward facing arrows, the second has two inward facing tails, and the third has one of each.  This causes the line with the two tails too look like it is longer even though the center line is still the same length.  This illusion breaks the perceptual process of depth cues.      "
"The mexican wave - process of understanding the interneuron communication, such as how the beau Ron process flows ( dendrites > axons > and so on). "
"The Mexican Wave and Neurotransmitters are very closely related in that without the Mexican wave (action potential), there would be no neurotransmitters firing messages throughout the brain. As Neurons are seen as the building block of the brain, they are thus found in the frontal lobe a well. These neurotransmitters (using action potential) can fire signals within the frontal lobe about specific abstract thoughts (""What if there was world peace?"") and this fire through Broca's Area where our speech is created and allow for us to verbalize these abstract thoughts. "
"The Mexican Wave demonstrates the action potentials for inter-neuron communication. Neurotransmitters are chemical signals that carry communication for the neuron through the brain. (Examples of Neurotransmitters: Hormones, Serotonin, Endorphins, and Dopamine) The frontal lobe of the brain consists of the primary motor cortex. It is the part of the brain that controls movement and produces speech. The Broca’s area is located in the frontal lobe of the brain that controls speech production. Therefore, the Mexican wave indicates the action potential for inter-neuron communication. As neurons communicate, neurotransmitters are released to carry their chemical messages to parts of the brain. So as the neurotransmitters carry their chemical messages to the frontal lobe to be received by a receptor in the Broca’s area of the brain, speech production occurs."
"The mexican wave helps explain the neurotransmitters job. The neurotransmitters are important inside the brain so that they can send messages to different places like the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe contains the Broca's area in which neurotransmitters send messages to in order for us to understand speech. "
"The Mexican Wave is a great mnemonic device that helps describe the way our inner neuron connections work. If you think about everyone doing the wave at a sporting event, you can imagine how the neurotransmitter moves from the dendrites, through the body cell of a neuron, and all the way to the axon terminals. A neurotransmitter is a chemical substance that carries information from neuron to neuron. We have tons of neurons in our brain, and they help the brain function, learn and store memories. In the front part of our brain, the area called the frontal lobe, is where we store our motor skills. In the prefrontal cortex, lies the Broca's area, which aids us in language and speech. If neurons are destroyed in these parts of the brain, we would loose that functioning. "
"The Mexican Wave is a term to describe inter-neuron communication. When a neuron receives a message in the dendrites, it gets passed along the axon towards the axon terminals. While it's in one neuron, the message moves like a wave and has a ripple-like effect through the axon, hence the Mexican Wave. When the message reaches the axon terminals, it gets released into the synaptic gap between the current neuron and the next one as a neurotransmitter. These messages bind to the fitting receptors and tell the next cell what to do. This all takes place in the brain as communication within your system. One part of the brain, the frontal lobe, is found at the top of your head and is responsible to thinking, attention and judgment. A smaller section within this lobe known as Broca's is responsible for speech production. When you receive information, neurons fire rapidly to send the information to Broca's where you're able to come up with a response. This part of the brain is vital for communication and wouldn't work without the messaging system of the brain, the neurons. "
"The Mexican Wave is a way to understand intern neuron connection. Then the neurotransmitters are what a transmitting the messages across the brain. So when the mexican wave happens it sends off neurotransmitters to receive the real message. The frontal lobe is a part of your brain that contains the primary motor cortex and allows you do have muscle movement which has to send off neurotransmitters so the brain nows to move your hands or to walk. Broca's area is located in the frontal lobe and is on the left side unless your left handed it could be on the opposite side or both and what it does is what do I want to say in response to what I am hearing."
"The Mexican Wave is an analogy that describes how neurons communicate with each other or an action potential. Neurons communicate by releasing neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers, to regulate processes in the body. Neurotransmitters are released from a neuron's terminal button into the synapse where they attach to the neighboring receptor cell to a relay a message or bring about a target response in the cell. This causes an action potential to occur only when it is strong enough to reach the threshold. Once the cell reaches threshold this causes Na ions to rush into the cell, depolarizing the membrane and K ions leave the cell. An example of communication by this electro-chemical process would be having a conversation with somebody. Your frontal lobe which contains your primary motor cortex and Brocas area would both need to be stimulated to do this. Your Brochas area is in charge of speech production so neurons would fire sending signals to that area to determine what you need to reply. Also, your primary motor cortex would be sending signals via neurons to move your mouth and tongue to produce speech. "
"The Mexican Wave is an analogy to describe action potential and the firing of a neuron. In The Wave, if you only have one or two people standing up and doing it, that is not enough to really get The Wave going. The same is true with action potential and not having enough ions to fire. If you have enough people going – or enough ions – then The Mexican Wave of action potential can fire! After the neuron fires, it releases chemicals called neurotransmitters into the synapses to go talk to other neurons. One of the locations this happens is in the frontal lobe of the brain, located just behind your forehead. In this lobe of your brain, things such as abstract thinking, attention, and speech production happen. Speaking of speech production, one of the areas in the frontal lobe is called Broca’s area. This area of the brain manages speech production."
"The Mexican Wave is an example to help understand the Inter-neuron communications in the brain. Neurotransmitters consist of many types including serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, endorphins, and hormones that are located in the brain. They are all part of an electrochemical process to send information across the brain. The frontal lobe is the lobe in the brain that controls abstract thinking, muscle movements, and attention. Broca’s area controls your response to certain things such as verbal responses to questions. These terms are directly related to each other because they describe the frontal lobe of the brain and its functioning."
"The Mexican Wave is an explanation of how a neuron produces an electrochemical responsible for communication between neurons. The electrochemicals, which are neurotransmitters, are used to communicate different messages across a space found between the neurons, the synapse. These neurotransmitters are responsible for the communication necessary between and within the different regions of the brain. For example, the frontal lobe is the part of the brain responsible for abstract thought and movement. Additionally, within the frontal lobe is a region responsible for different aspects of speech production, known as the Broca’s region. All of the communication between the neurons is made possible by the production and use of neurotransmitters."
"The Mexican Wave is basically just a term for how the inter-neuron connection works. Throughout the Mexican Wave, the dendrites are the receivers of the neurotransmitters. Next, the neurotransmitter flows through to the cell body, and through the axon that is myelinated (acts as a lubrication). After that, it moves to the axon terminal where the neurotransmitter is sent to the next neuron. There is a small space in between neurons, and this is called the synapse. Since the system is an electro-chemical process, the neurons would basically fry each other if they were to touch. This is why the synapse is in place. Neurotransmitters are the different chemicals that are released throughout the body, and all have different responsibilities. A few examples include Serotonin, Dopamine, and Endorphines. The front of the brain includes the Frontal lobes, which contains the Prefrontal Cortex,  Primary Motor Cortex, and the Broca's area. The Broca's area is basically the ""what do I want to say?"" part of the brain that produces speech production. If the Broca's area portion of the Frontal lobe were to be broken, then the neurons and neurotransmitters would have a hard time sending information to the Broca's area so that the individual would have problems coming up with something to say in response to someone speaking to them. Without neurons and neurotransmitters, feelings and life would impossible. "
"The Mexican Wave is done with crowds at a stadium where one part of the stadium raises and lowers their arms together and the section next to them continues this motion until it continues around the stadium several times. The crowd also yells during this. People in the stadium would be able to know the wave is coming to them next because of visual and auditory clues, which are interpreted by the Broca's area. The Broca's area is in the frontal lobe, which has a role in voluntary movement, and observes movements and language from others and is then able to repeat them. Neurontransmitters, which are what neurons use to chemically communicate, are what transmit the messages of seeing the wave coming and how to react to it."
"The Mexican Wave is essentially Action Potential. Action potential is the inter-neuron communication through electrical impulses. This is an all or none response. The axon terminals either fire the transmitters to communicate and send the message on to the next neuron or it decides it is unimportant and the message does not go any further. Neurotransmitters are chemical substances that transmits impulses across the synapse to help neurons communicate in action potential. The synapse is the area in between one neuron and another. The neurotransmitter is released at the end of the neurons terminal after the arrival of the impulse or message from the previous neuron. Neurotransmitters bind to receptors at one end of the neuron. The threshold is how much stimulating the neuron needs to be activated. The potential is facilitated by the movement of positively charged atoms in the channels of the membrane of the axon. This relates to the frontal lobe and the broca's area because it is all apart of the central nervous system. The Broca's area is located in the frontal lobe. The Broca's area is in charge of speech production and how to respond to what you are hearing. The frontal lobe involves muscle movement (Primary motor cortex), focus, and abstract thinking (prefrontal cortex). The neurons throughout your body send messages to these areas of the brain to facilitate movement. A neuron will receive a message such as ""your finger is burning, move it"" and the neurons continuously pass this message on until it reaches the primary motor cortex in the frontal lobe. Similarly, a neuron will receive a message ""this person is talking to me, respond"" and the neurons continuously pass the message along till it reaches the prefrontal cortex and the broca's area. "
"The Mexican wave is how a neuron communicates. Neurotransmitters are how the neurons communicate between cells. Frontal lobe is the front part of your brain that manages systems from behavior and other activities. Broca’s area is how we are able to communicate with are speech and sound. The Mexican wave and the neurotransmitter are dealing with neuron that allows us to be able to communicate. As the Mexican wave is the first part of  understanding the internal connectors, it then where the neurotransmitters help send to massages to the other systems. The Broca’s area also deals with communication but this allows us to be able to understand what commination is taking place. This is when you want to respond to someone. This all happen in the frontal lobe.  As all parts deal with communication, you can see that all four have to work together in order to ensure all proper communication is being heard, captured and responded to accordingly."
"The Mexican Wave is like a visual representation of the action potential in a neuron. It is how we get a message from the dendrites to the axon buttons/terminals. This is where the neurotransmitter is released, which is chemical that delivers the messages from neurons. There are neurons in all the different lobes of the brain, including the frontal lobe. This is where the prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, and Broca's area is located. The frontal lobe controls how we think and feel about certain things. Broca's is specifically how we respond to other people when the speak to you."
"The Mexican Wave is one part of the cell talking to the other. The axon terminals are the part of the cell that sends the neurotransmitter across the synapse to a receptor cell. The frontal lobe is responsible for motor, impulses, and cognitive functions it also houses the Broca’s are that controls language. They all deal with communication in one form or another."
"The Mexican wave is pneumonic device for how communication occurs within cells. It explains internal neuron communication. The firing of a neuron is an electro-chemical process called an action potential. The action potential must reach threshold before it will allow the neuron to fire. The firing of a neuron is an all or nothing event. If the dendrites receive an electrical impulse and it reaches threshold, then the neurotransmitters activate the neuron. The impulse then gets sent down the axon in pieces as the neuron fires and this causes a rippling effect. In non-myelinated neurons, this process is slow. Myelin helps the neuron to speed up the process by acting as a lubricant. The sodium-potassium pump releases at the top of each wave creating an influx of positive ions, which helps the movement of the impulse to take place. At the bottom of each wave, there is a still period where the neuron refuses to fire until it recuperates. Once the electrical impulse has made its way through the neuron, the axon terminal releases neurotransmitters into the synapse that contain the message. Neurotransmitters facilitate communication between cells and include serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, endorphins, and hormones. Each neurotransmitter then binds to its specific receptor. The neurotransmitters carry messages through the body to the brain until they reach the brain. The brain has many parts responsible for controlling different things. The frontal lobe of the brain contains the primary motor cortex, which controls muscle movements. The frontal lobe also contains the prefrontal cortex, which controls attention-based systems such as thoughts, focus, abstract thinking, and judgment decisions. Broca’s area is on the left side of the frontal lobe for right-handed people and can be on either side for left-handed people. It is responsible for speech production in response to auditory input."
"The Mexican Wave is the electric process of communication for the neuron. Neurotransmitters is the chemical process of communication for the neuron, dopamine. Frontal lobe is the front of the brain that controls abstract thinking. Broca's area is in the frontal lobe that controls speech production and what to say. The Mexican Wave, neurotransmitters, frontal lobe, and Broca's area are all connected by all of these working together to process communication from what we say to what we hear and how we interpret everything to create conversation through our brains. "
"The Mexican Wave is the electrical process of communication for the neuron. Neurotransmitters is the chemical process of communication for the neuron. Some examples of neurotransmitters are serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, endorphins, and hormones. The frontal lobe contains the Broca's area which is responsible for programming speech sound/production. Neurotransmitters binds to receptors in the brain which allows for communication to occur. For example, the neurotransmitters communicate signals from the receptors to the speech production (Broca's area) in the frontal lobe."
"The Mexican Wave is the fun behavior often seen at sporting events where people stand up out of their chairs and raise their arms in a flowing wave. As one row of people stands up, the next row gets excited and stands as well and it becomes a chain reaction. This phenomenon is also seen in the human brain. Neurons can too get excited and fire, which excite other neurons to fire, and you're left with a chain reaction of firing neurons that were caused by the release of neurotransmitters: chemicals that bind to neurons and cause them to evoke a physical reaction. The frontal lobe of the brain is the area that involves motor movement and abstract thinking. While people are doing the actual Mexican wave, they are using their frontal lobe to control their body movements. The Broca's area of the brain is the part that controls language. While people scream and say ""Woo!"" while they are doing the Mexican wave they are using their Broca's area. "
"The Mexican wave is the inter-neuron communication the electrical process of communication of the neuron while neurotransmitters are the chemical process of communication for the neuron. The frontal lobe of the brain is located in the front of the head and is responsible for muscle motor, attention, decision making and abstract thinking. The Broca’s area is also located in the frontal lobe and is responsible in knowing what to say in response to speech production. These terms all fit together because they are the communicative parts of function. The Mexican wave and the neurotransmitters are the ways in which the neuron communicates with one another. The frontal lobe and the Broca’s area help us to communicate with the outside world. These terms fit together because it about commuincation with the inside and outside world simultaneously."
"The Mexican Wave is used as metaphorical way to understand neuron communication. Neuron communication is an electrical process and moves as if you were watching the Mexican Wave. In other words, the wave symbolizes how the neuron behaves and moves. It symbolizes how the neurotransmitter travels from the dendrites through the soma and axon to the axon terminal where the neurotransmitter gets released across the synapse for the next neuron. A neurotransmitter’s pathway is an electrochemical process. The action potential, which is the electrical process, occurs when the dendrites receive an electrical impulse allowing the message to get sent in portions, like a wave. The rest of the pathway between neurons is a chemical process. Examples of known neurotransmitters are serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, endorphins, and hormones, all of which are increased or decreased in response to the body’s necessities. Dopamine plays a vital role in movement, which is part of the frontal lobe, a lack or an excessive amount of dopamine can result in a loss of control in body movements. The posterior portion of the frontal lobe contains the primary motor cortex. It also contains the anterior prefrontal cortex portion which is used for focusing and abstract thinking. The frontal lobe operates for everyday thinking, decision-making, speaking fluently, and it is where our personalities are formed. Within the frontal lobe, we have Broca’s area. This area contains motor neurons which are involved in the production of speech. If this area were to be damaged, speech production would decrease causing Broca’s aphasia."
"The Mexican Wave is what we think of when a crown does ""the wave"" at a sporting event. Neurotransmitters allow us to do tasks like this by sending signals in our brains. The frontal lobe is responsible for movement, so this would be where the process takes place. Broca's area is linked to speech production, so this area of the brain would take care of the process of us yelling and cheering."
"The Mexican Wave is when our neurons communicate with each other with neurotransmitters that are released form axon terminals and spread throughout the brain. The Broca's area is located in the frontal lobe and responsible for speech communication. When the Broca's area is not receiving these neurotransmitters, it cuts off our ability to speak about what we see going on. Our frontal lobe is located in the front of our brain and is responsible for attention, speech, and abstract, out of the box, thinking."
"The mexican wave shows how a neuron works. The best way to explain this is to think of a tree. The dendrites are going to recieve the message they are the tree branches.  The leaves of the tree that are on the end of the dendrites are call axon terminals that sends the messages to the dendrites. These messages then go though a cell body called the soma that then transfer the information through the tree stump which is the axon terminal which further sends the message. If the axon terminal is coated with sap that may be on the tree stump the technical term is myelin sheath that makes the message travel faster through the axon terminal. If this sheath is not there then it takes longer for the message to be received. The neurotransmitter sends the message by attaching to a receptor that it can fit with. How the frontal lobe fits in with the mexican wave and neurotransmitter is the frontal lobe is what process this information because it is made up of these neurons. The frontal lobe has the primary motor cortex which helps process abstract thinking. The frontal cortex also consists of the prefrontal cortex which helps us with our attention and focus. How Broca's area fits in all this is it's in the frontal cortex. Broca's area helps us with our speech. It helps us process what we are hearing and then we make words out of it with Broca's area help.. The nuerotransmitter sends the message to the dendrites."
"The Mexican Wave was an interpretive dance showing interneuron communication. They showed how neurotransmitters communicated with other neurons. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that carry messages throughout the brain. There are many kinds of neurotransmitters and they all do different things. The frontal lobe has to do with movement, focus, and language. Broca’s area is located in the frontal lobe and it is involved in responding to things you have heard."
"The Mexican Wave- Neurotransmitters-Neurotransmitters are released at the top of the axon.  Frontal Lobe-The frontal lobe is responsible for many things, such as controlling movements, speech, and thinking.  Broca's Area-Broca's area is part of the frontal lobe. It is primarily responsible for producing speech. "
"The mexican wave:  a flow of motion when people raise their hands and stand up.  Neurotransmitters:  chemical that is released at the synapse in response to incoming action potentials.  Frontal lobe:  the lobe in the front of the brain that serves higher functions such as language, motor functioning, memory, and thought.  Broca's area:  an area in the frontal lobe associated with the production of language.  All of these terms have a common point of flow.  Neurotransmitters are chemicals released that move from neuron to neuron in a Mexican wave type of fashion. Also the frontal lobe is within the brain and handles motor function which is where some neurotransmitters end up to send signals to the motor functions. The Broca's area is located within the frontal lobe and is associated with language which also requires neurotransmitters that run in a Mexican wave type of fashion. "
"The Mexican Wave: Refers to inter-neuron communication. Also known as the neuron's action potential."
"The moon illusion represents the brain’s unintentional tendency to assume the moon is larger when closer to the horizon and smaller when higher in the night sky. This is an example of a size constancy illusion; when the moon is closer to the horizon, it can be compared to objects on the earth (e.g., mountains, vast distances, buildings). When the moon is high in the sky there aren’t any objects to compare it to. Even though the moon would be the same size on the horizon as in the sky, the brain perceives the moon differently depending on its location in comparison to earthly objects. The elevated moon in the night sky can’t be perceived with any cues; all we know is it’s far away and doesn’t have anything around it. When the moon is on the horizon, we can more easily perceive it as a certain distance from us, which causes our brains to also fill in things like size. The comparison objects make that size perception possible, even if it isn’t actually correct."
"The parietal lobe would be the worst one to break for me. Why? The parietal lobe stores all the long term memories and acts as storgage. If there is one thing I could do I would want to remember all the trips and families memories that I have worked so hard to create. A person can always talk about those, other might get tired of hearing the same story. But at least it would be a positive memory to hold on to. "
"The process of attention refers to the brain’s ability to discriminate between more and less relevant information in a situation. With the vast amounts of sensory information always coming into the brain for perception, giving more and less attention to different pieces of information allows for a better understanding, rather than a jumbled, overwhelming assortment of input information that can’t possibly be processed effectively. The limitation of attention is that it causes the brain to sometimes miss discarded information that actually is relevant. An example of this is change blindness, or the inability to notice differences in the various characteristics of one’s atmosphere because that information wasn’t gathered, stored, and processed like other information. Top-down processing is largely responsible for the discarding of sensory input that wasn’t given due attention and results in change blindness. More specifically, endogenous attention is at play and is controlled by top-down processing; it involves focusing on information that is relevant to an individual’s expectations of the situation he or she is in. The brain expects certain pieces of information to be detected by sensory organs, so the information that actually ends up existing that is consistent with one’s expectations is given more attention. The contrast of endogenous attention is exogenous attention. It is an involuntary process in which an individual is bombarded with unexpected stimuli, and his or her attention is forcibly directed towards the surprise stimuli. A common example of this is the cocktail party effect: an individual in a loud atmosphere suddenly has his or her attention captured because someone shouted their name (or something very similar in sound to it). A psychological attention test referred to as Posner’s Cueing Paradigm gives validity to the differences between endogenous and exogenous attention. The task shows how intentionally-focused attention (endogenous) results in faster recognition of a stimulus because it is expected. Contrastingly, attention being grabbed by a surprising and unexpected stimulus (exogenous) results in slower recognition and sets into motion three mental operations: stopping of endogenous, focused attention; the shift of attention from the expected stimuli to the actual exogenous one; and the brain’s focus of attention on the new stimulus."
"The reason we study the difference between sensation and perception is a change of perception can change the sensation. An example is the many to many problem. We can get different perceptions from the same sensation. Sensation has both too much and too little imagination to explain perception. Sometimes one sensation leads to many perceptions. A visual would be the cube, and how you perceive it can change the sensation. "
"The reason we study the difference between sensation and perception is because what we perceive a situation or thing to be where as sensation is what it feels like. The rubber hand illusion was the greatest example of that. People thought the rubber hand was theirs for a second after being smashed by the hammer because their hand and the rubber hand were being stroked with the paint brush simultaneously. What we perceive isn't always what we sense. That is why it is important to know the difference.   "
"The reason we study the difference between sensation and perception is to learn how the same sensation can produce different perceptions. One example of this is inkblots. The same visual representation is delivered from the inkblot but there are many interpretations of the sensation."
"The rubber hand illusion is an example of one of the illusions that we discussed in class. During the rubber hand illusion, the process of perception is broken through the neuroplasticity of the brain. By stroking both the rubber hand and the real hand, the person's brain will begin to believe that the rubber hand belongs to them."
"The rubber hand illusion is my favorite and I would like to participate in the exercise myself one day. In this illusion, the woman was sitting at a table with one arm in front of her. A lifelike rubber hand was placed in front of her to make it appear that it was part of her own body. When the rubber hand was stimulated with the paint brush, the participant was able to sense the feelings from the paint brush rubbing the rubber hand. The participant's brain was tricked into thinking that the rubber hand was actually a part of her own body and she was able to perceive the rubbing of the detached rubber hand, even though the paint brush never actually touched her own body. The perceptual process in this experiment was that the woman was fooled into perceiving that she was sensing the feeling of the paint brush. However, this is just an example of how we may misinterpret things incorrectly and perceive something that didn't happen. "
"The rubber hand illusion is where there was a guy that would stroke your hand and the rubber hand that is divided by a board but still able to see it, with a paint brush in sync with each other for a minute then put away the paint brush and come back and smash the rubber hand with a hammer. The reaction of the participant was shocked as if it was their real hand which gives an example of the difference between perception and sensation. Since the guy was stroking both hands at the same time with the paint brush the participants got the sensation of it being their hands which made them perceive that when the rubber hand was hit with the hammer their initial reaction was shock or scared because they at first perceived it was their hand for a second. "
"The Rubber Hand Illusion was by far my favorite. This is a great example of how multi-sensory perception can influence how we perceive our bodies and how easy it is to trick the brain into adopting a new ""hand"". We see in the experiment that while both the rubber hand and the real hand are being stroked simultaneously, with the real hand being out of view, the brain begins to adapt to the perception that it can feel the hand being stroked (sensory), but it can only see the rubber hand, so that must be the real hand (perception). This experiment is a great example of how sensation and perception go hand-in-hand (no pun intended, lol). "
"The rubber hand illusion was one of my favorite illusions that we discussed.  This was my favorite because I recreated the experiment with my fiance and it was so crazy how your brain works. In the rubber hand illusion the perception that the rubber hand is your own and not your real hand is the illusion. You perceive the rubber hand as your own because the sensation of what is happening to your real hand is also happening to the rubber hand and you are seeing it happen to the rubber hand not your own so your brain accepts the rubber hand as your own hand. "
"The Rubin face, vase illusion. As soon as the faces were pointed out that was all I could focus on.When I saw the faces and that was all I could focus on that was called focus attention task because I was focusing on one thing. However before I noticed the faces I was trying to figure out what else I was seeing and that is called divided attention task where I was focusing on the white and the black at the same time. Our prefrontal cortex is also plays a role in this because it is helping me focus my attention to the picture."
"The study of cognitive psychology was sparked when the concept of behaviorism started to unravel, and the computer systems were developed. In this time they began to link the process of cognition to different computer processes that seemed to function in the same way. This allowed cognitive process to be tested as an objective point of view, instead of introspection where they ask people what they are thinking. Since they could relate a way of seeing the processing it seemed to be more valid. This research continued to advance as the military used it for testing individuals to see which tasks they would succeed in, marketing used it for advertising strategies and they used it for testing on memory experiments with Miller’s Magic Number."
"The temporal lobes are responsible for the primary organization of sensory input, if damage does happen to the temporal lobes then this area of the brain people may experience all sorts of disturbance, some disturbance of auditory sensation perception, the inability to pay attention to what they see or hear, not able to understand language, impaired to long/short term memory, emotional disturbance, altered sexual behaviors, with all that may also occur seizures, sence of humor and become obsessive. This would not be an actual person anymore in my opinion I believe this would be the worst to me because I want to be able to still be me and you can not if you damage your temporal lobes. "
"The term attention refers to a process within our visual field that allows us to see (enhance) distinct information, and ignore (inhibit) other information. Throughout our everyday lives, we are constantly looking at the entire world in our own views. While living life, we may experience a form of change blindness, which refers to the inability to recognize changes in the physical aspects of a scene or our visual field. When we are looking into our visual field, humans have a form of attention called endogenous attention which means our attention span comes from within our perception; we already know and have experienced it in the past, so when we are looking for something specific, we are able to control our internal attention. Over the years, scientists wanted to test this type of attention span, which is where Posner's cueing paradigm comes into play. His test includes endogenous and exogenous attention strategies that force you to either keep your attention where it is at, or control your own attention by picking up your eyes and moving them to a different space.  "
"The theory that states individuals will match pattern features to those in our memories is called Feature Matching Theory, in essence when we look at thinks, we're automatically looking for a pattern that we're already familiar with. There are two processes that this theory takes a look into which are Top down, and bottom up processing. Top down processing is once a stimuli has been brought to the brain by a sensory system, it determines how the information will be used. Bottom up processing is different in that it's goal is to take every piece of information and create a whole idea. Word superiority falls into these two processes in that it is the idea that individuals, struggle to piece separated words together. That individuals can better recognize whole words with letters spaced out appropriately close. This idea goes back to the theory and processes in that the brain seeks to find a common patterns and when words are displayed ""appropriately"", they can be distinguished or read better/faster than separate, spaced out, and even scrambled letters. "
"The top down- bottom up processing approaches are defined in the Information Processing Approach. Top-Down Process is a process used when you use your outer knowledge and experiences to reach the best possible answer. The Bottom-Up Processing is the approach described as the ""bigger picture."" So in this case you would wait, until all of the facts are there and then piece them altogether at once. The feature matching theory is an example of a bottom-up processing approach. An example of the feature matching theory is the experiment that we did is the Pattern Change Experiment. In the experiment, we were asked to search for a certain letter in 5 seconds. The letter was either place with a bunch of letters that looked similar to it or dissimilar to it. During this exercise, our brains used the ""Bottom-Up"" approach, in which we look at the whole picture, to find the letter. It was much easier to find the letter when it was placed with other letters that were dissimilar to it. Word superiority is the phenomenon that happens to us when we read a word easily, even when the letters are switched, as long as the first and the last letter are where they should be. This would be and example of Top-Down Processing. "
"The type of brain research I am most intrigued by is behavioral. This type of brain research looks at behavior, so what is directly observable. One example of this is response time. So, the researcher would ask a question and time how long it took the participant to answer. Once the researchers ran all of their trials and collected all of their data, they would use those observations to draw conclusions. "
"The word Word superiority refers that people can recognize letters within a word but when letters are isolated it comes with more difficulty. Top down processing is how our bains are making information useful that was already brought into the brain by one or more sensory systems, this is a cognitive process witch inticiates our thoughts, bottom up processing refers to sensory information as information is coming into the brain. Feature matching theory is when we try to match patterns and recognitins to a feature. This all comes together because it all has to do with process what we see and hear around our enviroment nd how we want to use that information."
"The worst lobe to break I think is the temporal lobe. This lobe is responsible for helping us recognize face's and helps us process hearing and our visual memories. Wernicke's is also part of the temporal lobe and this helps us process what people are saying to us. Without this lobe I would feel like a vegetable because I could have a blank facial expression because I would have no idea what people are saying to me. Also recognizing my friends and families face's is really important and would be very sad if I couldn't recognize who my mom was for example. Having memories is a special thing to have and helps us grow. These are just some of the ways that not having this lobe I think would make life not so special. I almost put the parietal lobe which is also responsible for memory, taste, and balance but with the temporal lobe it almost makes us have a personality being able to acknowledge people and have memories and hear familiar things. How this lobe exactly processes memories is from the help of the occipital lobe which is how we see. "
"The worst lobe to break in my opinion would be the parietal lobe. If I were to damage this lobe, I would lose the ability to manage my memories, process the space around me, and input sensory information. I would no longer be able to recall any memories and have problems storing new information. I could no longer be able to perceive how close I am to objects or how close things were to me. Damage to this lobe would result in losing the ability to decipher sensory input, visual, auditory, olfactory, and touch. I  "
"The worst lobe to break in my opinion would be the parietal lobe. It is responsible for spatial processing, memory management, and it also holds the primary somatosensory cortex. Damage to this are would cause the loss to differentiate all of our sensory input. Making it difficult to process visual, auditory, or touch sensations. It would also make it hard to tell how close things are to a person or how far away they are from something. The person would also lose the ability to recall long term memory and make it hard to store new memories."
"Theories of the human mind can be dated as far back as Plato, where he described the brain as a backbone of all processes. It wasn't until the 1800-1900, that exploration of consciousness had fully started to grow and take off. With the turn of the 1900s, behaviorism seemed to take over the field of psychology. This new era of psychology focused on what could be observed and measured. Then around 1950s, cognitive psychology started to stand as it's own branch/discipline. The focus of this theory came to change largely due to the technology that came about during this time period. The technology that became available during this period made it possible to test predictions, and then specify the order of activities. Which ultimately made observations less subjective. A big part of this theory has its tie to Artificial Intelligence (AI). In which psychologist have sought to discover the link between computer functioning and human thought. Artificial intelligence "
"There are cells capable of electrochemical transmissions such as neurons they transmit information threw an electro-chemical systems called the mexican wave witch is a neuron impulse. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that carry neural messaaes across synapses, the frontal lobes is made up of one fourth of the cerebral cortex witch allows you to think, solve, process incoming sensory information. Broca's area has to do with the way we produce speech, if this part of the brain is damage then you get Broca's aphasia witch is fragmented speech. These all go together because it all has to do with transmission of language and speech and recieving and transmitting information."
"There are different types of research that can be done with the brain. One approach is the behavioral method which focuses on observable behavior. This type is good because it's easy to do without hi-tech equipment and can be done with a vast amount of people relatively inexpensively. There are negatives though, including expectancy effects. If people know they're being tested, they may automatically perform the way they're expected to or the instructor may observe what he expects to see. There's human error with this method. Another question that comes from the behavioral method is the question of what is the brain doing? During all of this, the experimenter is only documenting observable behavior, which can sometimes be hard to measure and you aren't able to see which part of the brain is working. For example, athletes can be observed and measure by their physical performance, but we have no idea how the process works within their brain due to lack of information with this method. While it's a good method and has driven tons of studies, information, and theories to psychology, there are a few drawbacks."
"There are different ways we process sensation and perception. Two different ways we do this are through top down processing and bottom up processing. Top down processing is how our perception of things is determined by our past experiences. An example of this type of processing would be word superiority which is we can understand words that are misspelled due to our previous experiences with the words. Bottom up processing is how a person processes the senses their body is taking in. An example of this is feature matching theory which is where a person will group things together based on how we find them similar using our senses. Like when a person groups things together by how the are visually similar. "
"There are many arguments of what the definition of what attention is so they outlined the failures and successes to allow a clearer idea of what attention is. One failures of selection in space of attention is change blindness which is the failure to detect changes in the physical aspects of a scene. The reason we experience change blindness is because we are focused on one thing rather than the whole picture. Almost all change blindness is because of controlled attention. Controlled attention is what we chose to focus on at a given time. Controlled attention is applied because we are focused on our goals and what interests us. Our controlled attention might be focused on the ball game that is going on on the tv that we don't notice the dog chewing on our shoe. If the dog would have been chewing on the shoe directly below the tv is when we would most likely notice it which is a example of what Posner's cueing paradigm."
"There are many different ways in which we perceive things going on around us. Top-down processing and bottom-up processing are two different ways to perceive things, that may happen simultaneously. Top down processing is when you use your previous knowledge to create your perception. I think this can be seen through word superiority, which is the tendency of people to view letter clusters as always forming words. I think that this is because you have your previous expectations of what words are formed from certain letters, so you already see them as spelling that word even when they are not. Bottom up processing means to create your perception based on your sensory information given. This can be seen through feature matching theory, because one is trying to use certain sensory stimuli or features of an object to figure out what it is. One has to match a lot of different features together and then create their perception."
"There are many reasons why it's important to study sensation and perception. Sensation and perception both have very different meanings. A sensation is known as the intake, otherwise known as the stuff that is coming directly into your brain from the outside world; it is what you ""sense"". Perception, on the other hand, is the interpretation and how we make the sensation out to be. There is no perception without a sensation. The first question that should be asked while studying the difference is, why is it important? The best answer to that is that we can have different perceptions from just one sensation. The two are not equal to each other, meaning that we can perceive things differently from just one sensation. Another reason why we study the difference between the two is that we want to know why one causes the other. Vision sensation is extremely important to how we perceive things. One example of how a perception may be different from a sensation is if there is a dystrophy of the Retina in the eye, causing problems with the Rods and Cones. Rods and Cones control night vision adaptation, sharpness, color, and other things. If there were an issue with this, for example, someone who has a sensation of ""red"" may perceive the color to be gray because of an issue with the Cones in the Retina. Knowing the difference between sensation and perception is important because it gives us a more clear view on why humans all think, feel, and act in different ways. "
"There are many types of brain research and one that comes to mind for me is, Dissociation which is to show that one act affects another act and this applies for events, activities. One act might be affected by this variable while another may not be. This is not a cause an effect to say, but rather an interaction between the variables. A good example of this might be the ice cream study where ice cream sales was thought to have an effect on crime rising. This is better called Causal Brain research. (Which was not a correlational), the reason ice cream sales went up was because it was hot."
"There are three types of brain research being behavioral, correlational brain, and causal brain research. Behavioral brain research takes a direct approach in observation which can be done through a variety of methods such as accuracy, response time, judgments, and protocol collection. For example, if one were to be observing behavioral brain function based on response time, it generates a conceptual idea of how well processing in the brain occurs based on ones knowledge. If one was in an interview, and the interaction of a question and answer set up, one could measure the extent of processing. Some things to consider in this method of brain research is the ceiling and floor affects. When using response time, having an awareness of the demands of the situation is important as well as the speed of questioning and allotted time. "
"There are two different processing techniques and they are top-down processing and bottom up processing .  Top down processing is pulling out information from memory after being stimulated by sensory information.  This type of processing is driven by one's own knowledge and experiences.  Bottom up processing is driven solely by sensory information taken in from the physical environment. These influence our perceptions of things.  Our perceptions are how we interpret sensory information.  The interaction between the two processing systems produces representations of the sensory information that we picked up.  The Feature Matching Theory is when our brains search for the simplest yet most characteristic representations/features of objects and the presence of these features causes a match between objects. So, if a figure was presented to someone, their processing of the figure would include an interaction between top down and bottom up.  Say, this figure was a box with two vertical lines down the middle with two ovals on the outside of the lines. Bottom-up processing is receiving information from our vision that there physically are two lines and four ovals inside of a box.  Top down and the Feature Matching Theory now work together to figure out if the figure is something other than just lines and ovals.  We pull from our knowledge that the ovals could represent paws of an animal and that the lines could represent a tree.  Therefore, we can conclude that this may be a picture of an animal climbing a tree.  Feature Matching Theory is searching for similar features of other objects, and top down processing is pulling that knowledge about what bear paws look like after physically seeing the ovals.  All of these terms fit together and without one we could not make out some objects or organize them in our brains. "
"There are two different ways perception is carried out, either top down processing or bottom up processing. Bottom up processing is done by information being perceived based on the sensation you are receiving from your visual field. One example of this is the feature matching theory. This is a theory of how we recognize items that are familiar to us. In this theory they state that we decide an image is something by looking at defining features, if the object has certain features then it must be a certain thing. In deciding what the sensation is you are perceiving, you are using multiple parts of the brain at once to make sense of the visual field. The opposite of the bottom up processing would be the top down processes. This is taking the receptive field and making it into a visual field we can understand. The perception you perceive is based off of the background knowledge you have acquired. An example of this process would be word superiority. With the background knowledge of different words, when seeing letters you expect certain things to be spelled. So, one sensation can lead to multiple perceptions. This theory is the thought process behind knowing what a word is even though it is written wrong, or not all the way. Although the two processing systems are opposite, you use them both at the same time to perceive what is happening, it is not one or the other being used."
"There are two different ways that we think and process information, from a bottom up or top down approach. In a bottom up process, we think of things as derived from sensory information of what we can see. In a top down approach, we derive things by context of the situation of our knowledge and understanding. An example of this would be if you were to look at a picture with 5 animals and 1 is different your bottom up process would be to say that the one that is doesn’t look the same, is obviously the odd one of the group, it does not look like the rest. Your top down process would be to know that if 4 of the animals are cows and 1 is a pig, that the pig would be the one that is different because it is a pig. This goes along with the idea of the feature matching theory, which states that we as humans have a way of categorizing object in general that must have certain features. An example would be that all vehicles must have four wheels, four doors, and a steering wheel or that all fish have scales and live in water. However, this theory does not always state true if you look at it more deeply. A truck is a vehicle; however, it can have more than four wheels or doors. These things all vary depending upon the object or idea. You can also assume the same thing when it comes in to terms of words and language. People think you must always have letters in order for them to make sense of your understanding of the language. However, according to the word superiority idea, if the first and last letters of a word are the same, you are in fact able to still read and understand words in a sentence without them being in the correct order."
"There are two main types of processing we have looked at in this exam block: bottom up processing and top down processing. With top down processing, we start with an established understanding or expectation and that shapes how we process what we are hearing or seeing. This leads to things like seeing things we expect faster than things we don’t expect (the Australian cousin example). A byproduct of this is the word superiority effect. With this effect, we can take an input that is semi-vague and view it differently depending upon context. In one of our examples, this is shown with a slanted H or a broken A to let us read CAT or THE depending on which way we are reading. With bottom up processing, there are certain cues that we look for to tell us certain things like perspective, similarity, closure, and motion parallax. We expect something that is further away to look smaller, shapes to be closed and complete, and objects further away to appear to move less as we move than things that are closer. These sets of heuristics lead to things like feature matching theory. In feature matching theory, our brain has the basic components of letters and shapes stored and if an object has those features then our mind can process down that path faster."
"There are two perceptual processes: top down processing and bottom up processing. Top down processing is guided by our knowledge that has been acquired from previous experiences and memories. In other words, top down processing creates perceptions based on our background knowledge. An example of this process would be word superiority. Using our background knowledge of words, one is able to expect how words are to be spelt by recognizing visual patterns based on previously processed information. This is why one is able to still understand papers and sentences when spelling errors are present because we are able to infer the misspelled word(s) using our background knowledge. The reverse process of top down processing would be bottom up processing. This process (bottom up processing) uses your visual field to perceive information rather than our background knowledge. An example of this process would be the feature matching theory, which helps us to compare and match an image picked up by our senses to something familiar to us. This theory explains that one is able to determine what an image is based on its defining features and characteristics. Thus, the presence of defining features on an image indicates a match. These processes may contradict how images and information are sensed and perceived; however, both are used simultaneously to process images and information more accurately."
"There are two types of processing information, top-down and bottom-up. Top-down processing is controlled by context information across the several stages of processing and perceptual representation, where our perceptual system is what interprets the information. A good example of this is be word superiority, an occurrence where a letter is understood in the context of the word better than if it were alone. Therefore, we are able to read words that are scrambled or misspelled because of our expectation of what is supposed to be there.  Bottom-up processing is driven by our sensory information and the features that we see. An example for this would be the feature match theory, where we are connecting the simple characteristics of an object to the model we have in our mind. For example, a robin is a robin because it had wings and feathers but also flies and sings, and those are characteristics which make it a robin. "
"There is a difference between sensation and perception, and studying that difference is important.  Sensations are the raw data.  They are the activation of the sensory receptors like the ears or eyes.  Perception is processing a sensation and organizing it in the brain.  Perception is telling you what to make from a sensation.  We can get multiple different perceptions from just one sensation.  Knowing the different is important because we then will know that perceptions are not possible without sensations.  For example, say I can see a woman running toward me with a mean look on her face.  From this sensation that i sensed through my vision, I can perceive that the woman was mad and coming to harm me. This example is showing that without sensations, perception is not possible. "
"There is a difference between the terms sensation and perception. Sensation is raw stimuli put into your system. This is the information we receive fro the outside world. Perception, on the other hand, is how the message gets interpreted. This is an interesting field to study because of how different people react to given information. There are some things that are innate and most people react the same to. But, there are also times when people react very differently to the exact same stimuli. For example, a Led Zeppelin song could be playing on the radio, which is the stimulus. An elderly man who enjoys classical music might be annoyed by the sound - perception - and turn it off. Meanwhile, a twenty-something young adult is listening to this same song on the radio - same stimulus - and greatly enjoys the sound - different perception - and turns up the volume. Another example would be two people looking at a blue shirt - stimulus - and one says its aqua - perception - and the other says its turquoise - different perception. It's neat to study the difference so that we can see how the two relate from person to person, and what makes us think differently with certain information. "
"There is a physical side that is depicted by the sensory input of sensation but not everyone will react to the same, different experiences cause an individual’s perception of the same stimuli to be different. The reason we study the difference between sensation and perception is simply to understand the “mind” and how it works, or to understand what makes different people react differently to the same stimuli."
"There is an area of illusions that we discussed in class called size-constancy illusions. One of these illusions was called the moon illusion, which is the illusion that fools us into thinking that the moon by the horizon is bigger than the one in the sky even if they are the same size. Our perception is that the moons are different in size because our brain tricks it into thinking that the one on the horizon is larger."
"There were so many people involved with starting cognitive psychology beginning with a French philosopher named Descartes who showed us that the mind and body are separate. Locke showed us that our thoughts were like a series of images, and Berkeley showed us that that justice and truth were not able to be used by images. Cognitive psychology started off in philosophy which made lots of good points, but in the end it couldn’t answer the questions needed with just one argument. This is when cognitive psychology became a science that way there could be more than one path or argument to answer questions. Cognitive psychology started being researched because we wanted to study the things we could not see, and answer questions like “what is happening on the inside?” and “why do we think what we think?”. In 1879 the first modern psychology lab was started by Wundt who studied our consciousness and introspection.  An American student of his named Titchener went off to further study and broaden the study of cognitive psychology by looking into sensations and mental activity. Since then there has been many scientists to help further our study in cognitive psychology and new discoveries are and experiments are continued today."
"This brain research is studying if participants can recall pictures they viewed at a setting then showed the pictures again a week later. The participants did not know that they would be ask to see these pictures again therefore they did not bother to think about to memorize them. The trick to this was one group received a pill that interferes with the hippocampus and makes it difficult to recall emotional things. With the hippocampus being involved this makes it difficult for them to store new memories. The second group received a pill as well but this pill was called the placebo pill because it did nothing it was more than likely a sugar pill. A week later when the participants were showed the pictures again the group that received the placebo pill recalled more of the pictures. It's no surprise that the group that received the actual pill didn't recall more of the emotional pictures. This kind of experiment can help establish which parts of the brain are working when during an xray and certain drug are given before hand."
"Those messages have been seen all over social media: a long paragraph that you get halfway through reading before you realize that most of the words have mixed up letters in them, yet you were still able to read them. This phenomenon is called word superiority, and it happens because we use top-down processing when we perceive things. Top-down processing relies on our previous experiences to help us form the context of what we are seeing. When you read a four-lettered word that begins with R and ends with D but might have nonsense in the middle, your mind knows that, normally, you would be seeing the word ""read"" and make that assumption for you. This is one example of the shortcuts, or heuristics, that our mind can make due to top-down processing. There is also bottom-up processing, which relies on sensory information. By using top-down and bottom-up processing, we are able to recognize images and items in our world. There are different theories for how we recognize. One is the feature matching theory. This theory describes how we search for characteristic features of an object, and then if we find a match in our mind, we can recognize what it is. An example of this would be differing types of handwriting and how even though people use different formats to write certain letters, we normally can still know an A is an A because all have similar features: two slanting lines and a horizontal one. "
"Throughout the brain, there are neurons communicating through an inter-neuron messaging system with one another in a wave like movement, referred to as the Mexican Wave. When this movement of communication between the neurons occur, certain neurotransmitters are released to send certain chemical messages between the neurons, such as a release of dopamine in the system is connected to having a happy feeling. These neurons run all throughout the brain in each lobe and each lobe communicates through these neurons, the one I will be talking about today is the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is located in the front region of the brain, where the control for muscle movements occurs in the primary motor cortex, abstract thinking and attention are controlled by the prefrontal cortex, and the speech production of how we wish to respond to something that we hear occurs in the Broca’s."
"To begin, cognitive psychology can be defined as the study of mental processes in individuals. When philosophers and psychologists first discovered the thoughts of researching the human thinking mind, there were many tests and experiments that needed to be performed in order to understand a deeper meaning of the context. When an experiment is performed, the goal is to be able to test the experimenter's hypothesis and meet the expectations. If the expectations are not correct, then another experiment must be performed with different variables, etc. All of these different experiments that were performed in order to understand cognition lead to what is known as Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is a form of technology that is meant to impersonate human brain activity, or trick humans into thinking it is performing like a human. There are so many different forms of artificial intelligence that we see in our everyday lives, such as Siri, the iPhone communication app, or video games. It was the discovery of computers that lead researchers to understand how the mind works in different branches and parts. With the advancement of artificial intelligence, the controversy between mind-brain connection arose. The controversy is where researchers argue whether the mind is only for mental thinking and the brain is only for physiological purposes, or if they rely on each other. I personally feel that if there is no brain, there is no mind. All of these topics relate to each other and the world would not have the evidence and research we do now without each one of these key terms. "
"To construct perception, the brain uses a combination of processes to interpret our surroundings. The processes are known as top bottom processing and bottom up processing. These processes work together to from perception but in slightly different ways. For example, the concept of top bottom processing compares sensory input with existing knowledge to complete objects. It is guided by previous experiences and acquired knowledge. A great example of top bottom processing is word superiority. Word superiority is the process of spelling words. How this works is the mind will match features of letters and the expectations to complete the word. The process of bottom up processing uses sensory input to construct perception. Unlike top bottom, the bottom up approach relies solely on sensory input. The bottom up processing is the concept behind feature matching theory. Feature matching theory is used to explain how the brain matches different features of an object to identify it."
"To define artificial intelligence, you need experiments, cognitive psychology, and mind-brain. Artificial intelligence is constantly trying to make a computer mimic the mind of a human. To do this, a person would need to study cognitive psychology which is the study of how humans think and study the mind-brain which is a display of where a mind and brain connect. After a person studies, to develop an artificial intelligence would take a lot of experiments to find relationships between hardware and human. Once all this is accomplished an artificial intelligence would look like a computer but act like a human."
"To explain the feature matching theory, using terms as word superiority, top down/bottom up processing are needed. The overall theory that a person matches things based features that an object possess. To do this a person may use either bottom up or top down processing when matching an object. Top down creates the object using background knowledge, while bottom up uses a persons senses to create the object. When it comes to words, we can use the feature matching theory when it comes to word superiority, by the way we perceive letters to spell a word, which a person matches a set of features required to make out what a word is. "
"To me the reason why we study sensation and perception is because they are two different things that help to allow us to think and process all the information that is coming into our brains. Sensation is what is coming into the brain an perception is how we see something, what we think it is (which can be different for everyone). I think that without the study of these two fields we would all be the same, and there would be the same answer for items, for example, water. Water has a name in every country or language. What if we didn't study sensation and perception and everyone called water (water), not what their native tongue knows it as."
"(#2) Another part of the brain that is heavily influential in our everyday lives it attention. What we pay attention to, what happens without our attention, and how we do it. Attention is defined as the ability to focus on something specific, all while ignoring other things around you. In the same moment we are able to give some things our attention while selecting what other things around us to ignore and keep attention away from. Some cases, we lack giving our attention to our surroundings and things can move and change on us without us ever having any idea this is happening. This phenomenon is known as change blindness. This is where you can completely miss a change within your visual field simply because it wasn’t within your attention. Another phenomenon of attention is known as endogenous attention, also known as controlled attention. It is from the top-down processing of your brain and is where you determine what specific object needs your attention and you scan your visual fields for all the similar objects in that category, and narrow it down to the specific thing you are looking for. It is easily broken as you scan your visual field however, because you can be distracted by other stimuli that is interesting and captures your attention momentarily. When your attention is “grabbed” by another stimuli (that you weren’t looking for to begin with) then it is called exogenous attention, which is driven by top-down processing. These to attention processes are controlled by Posner’s Cueing Paradigm, which cues your brain into the differences in those two processes. It helps your brain stop its original purpose of viewing (endogenous), focus on the new interesting stimuli (exogenous), and then redirect back to the original goal and begin looking into a new location (endogenous). "
"(#3) Cognitive psychology is the study of the thinking mind. It is typically studied because scientists are very curious and they, along with most other people, want to know how and why the brain works like it does. It has been an ongoing debate on if the mind and the brain are the same thing or not. Mind-Brain approaches try to determine and prove where the mind and brain connect, and if they are the same unit. Research is done to determine why and how the brain works in many ways, and one is by experiments. Experiments are done to find a causal relationship of variables, which has to be able to be manipulated by other scientists. Experiments have variables in it, which are things that change or stay the same to control the experiment’s results. As years went by and experiments were completed, research was done, and ideas were developed, and in 1949 the first computer was created, known as the BINAC. These computers were some of the first signs of using artificial intelligence, where the computers have been programmed to simulate the minds of people.  Examples of these are Siri, Watson, machines in hospitals, GPS systems, automatic coffee machines, and many more. "
"(#4) There are two well-known processes of how the brain intakes sensory information, processes it, and determines what it sees (perception). The first of these is Bottom-Up processing, which is where the brain takes the sensory input into the brain and makes a mental picture of what it sees and what the input was. The second process is top-down processing, where the brain creates a mental picture of what it perceives from the input, existing background knowledge, and the expectations of what it should look like. Included in the top-down processing is Word Superiority, which explains that our brain can recognize words that are scrambled because of our expectation of how it should be spelled. If the first and the last letters are correct, but the middle is scrambled, we are still able to recognize the word, thanks to word superiority. These two models came about in the twentieth century, during the heavy research done by Gestalts Psychologists. They came up with ways to group similar things that we see to make sense of them easier. Another model of perception they uncovered was the Feature-Matching Theory,  which is the theory that we group objects and match them up based on a set of specific features required to be in that object’s group.

"todd 1. Sensation and perception are heavily related in many ways. It takes sensations to get perceptions, and memory of past sensations and perceptions make it easier to interpret. I believe that we study the difference of the two to help better understand the functions that our brain goes through when it see things and then it can hopefully determine why people can see the same thing and perceive things differently, even though the sensations that are being input are the same.    "
"todd 3. The brain is researched in 3 types, and those types have many ways of research. One way of research in an EEG; which it a type of correlational research. It shows patterns that are associated with brain activity but can’t show causes of the activity; just correlation (Hints the name). An EEG is performed by placing wires and things on the head to detect brain activity, often used to track in the stages of sleep. It is a very low costing test  and minimally invasive, while the results from it can be very beneficial with excellent temporal resolutions. "
"todd 5. Embodied cognition is the idea that the brain can imagine itself doing something and it will have the same effect on the brain as actually doing it. For example, if you are imagining yourself folding a t-shirt like you do every day, your brain will start working like you are actually doing it, and the muscles you would use become activated. Too bad doing this won’t actually get your laundry done! ;) "
"todd 6. One of the experiments that we conducted this year had to do with pattern changes and being able to identify a “target letter” among either similar or dissimilar groups of letters. The groups of letters were the independent variable in the experiment, where the dependent variable was the target letter itself. This resulted in showing that it is easier for our brains to find a specific letter in a group of letters that are completely different, rather than similar to the letter we’re hunting. "
"todd 7. Although it would be awful to damage or break any lobes of the brain, I think the worst one for me to break would be the frontal lobe. It contains Broca’s Area, where the brain decides what to say, and the Primary Motor Cortex, which controls all of the muscle movements in your body. Without that, we would practically be immobile, and I for sure wouldn’t be sitting here typing this paper right now without it. The Frontal lobe also contains the processes of abstract thinking and judgement making. These damages would be awful and we currently have very little to no assistance or cures for them if we were to break our frontal lobe, which is partly why I chose this area. Other areas contain your sight, hearing, or senses which you can live without with the assistance of many accommodations. (My second choice of what not to break would have to be the Temporal lobe, because lack of face recognition would be awful, especially for me as an aspiring teacher!)"
"todd 8. One of my favorite illusions from this class was the American flag color illusion. In this, you stare at a flag that’s colors have been replaced with green, black, and yellow. You stare at it and your neurons in the on/off cells for those colors absorb it, so when it goes away those color neurons are turned off, but the red, white, and blue colors show in reciprocation of the other colors previously being on, leaving an image of a true American flag in your vision.  "
"todd(#1) The brain cortex, sometimes scientifically known as the “wrinkly part”, is made up of four lobes: the Frontal lobe, the Parietal lobe, the Occipital lobe, and the Temporal lobe. Within these lobes, there are a few “landmarks” that we should know about. One of them is the Broca’s Area, with is located in the Frontal lobe, and it is in charge of speech production, or deciding what to say. The entire Frontal lobe is in the front of your brain; kind of all the stuff in front of a headband if you were wearing one. It’s in charge of many important aspects including abstract thinking, judgement making, and the PMC that controls muscle movements. So for our body to function all of the parts of the brain need to communicate to each other. For example, if you want to ask someone to pass you the salt and pepper, your brain has to decide what to say, say it, and extend your hand out to receive what you asked for. All of those mini-actions are controlled in different areas of the brain, so the neurons have to communicate to each other what they’re doing so we can function properly. This communication is done by neurotransmitters, which is chemical processes in the brain brought on by the neuron dopamine, which causes the processes of communication. The neurotransmitter is released by an axon terminal into the synapse and finds and binds itself to a receptor that it fits to. This process is known as The Mexican Wave, or Action Potential, which is just the electrical process that goes into neuron communication. "
"Top down and bottom up processing are both associated with sensation and perception. The top down processing is guided by context information or perception whereas the bottom up processing is motivated by sensory information or stimuli. A negative affect of bottom up processing is that is it unable to take into consideration word superiority, whereas top down processing is able to and relies on it in order to carry out functions. The feature matching theory suggest that the human processes of cognition allow us to make connections from memory. Feature matching theory processes information in a parallel."
"Top down processing and bottom up processing are two different models that have been employed to try to help explain how perception operates.  Top down processing develops a representation of perception based on information that the individual already has.  This means that your past experiences have an influence on the way you interpret the information you are perceiving and evaluating.  A common example of this is the word superiority phenomenon.  This demonstrates how we always understand letters to spell words.  This can be demonstrated with the paragraphs that are written with the first and last letter of every word in the correct spots, but all other letters are jumbled within each respective word.  The result of top down processing and the background information we have on words, we are able to read the paragraph without issue.  On the other hand, bottom up processing is the development of perception from the direct sensory input that is present.  An example of this is found in the feature matching theory.  Feature matching theory states that we match or pair objects through specific characteristics required for that object.  For example, to identify that a rectangle is a rectangle it must have four straight sides that intersect to form four right angles.  The four sides may or may not be equal in length, but the parallel sides must be equal in length to each other.  The information we receive from the direct sensory input allows for the perception to occur.    "
"Top down processing and bottom up processing are two of the ways that can be used to help understand perception. Bottom up processing is when start at the bottom with observable patterns that we can see. Bottom up processing means that outside information is taken in first then sent to the brain to help us make decisions. Top down processing is when behavior is done first by something that you were expecting to see. These are both very important terms to know when talking about perception because each one can make you perceive things differently. A type of way we can learn also learn about perception is through feature theories, through this our mind only remembers the features of a certain image, this technique can be used when looking at letters. This is sometimes more easily done when looking for letters in a word instead of random jumbled up letters this is defined as word superiority. "
"Top down processing has to do with our perceptions and how they influence the way we look at certain pieces of an object. For example, in the word superiority effect we can easily recognize certain letters presented in certain words rather than by themselves. Top down processing uses our knowledge or expectations to lead our learning processes due to our memory and experiences. Bottom up processing is more like a structural learning process using step by step decisions to piece together the information. Top down and bottom up processing both have to do with our perception on how we see and understand things. Another perception theory is the feature matching theory which is when we pick apart and try to recognize certain pieces by trying to use our memory to recognize the certain objects or patterns. For example, when looking at the letter A and knowing it has two vertical lines and a small parallel line, and recognizing it’s a letter A because of those certain characteristics.  "
"Top down processing is controlled by the context of information. Word superiority is key to the idea of top down processing. An example of word superiority is that we can read jumbled words as long as the first and last letters are correct. Our brain fixes the rest because we like to read words. Bottom up processing is driven by sensory information or perceptions of sensory input. The feature matching theory is a good example of bottom up processing. It is based on simple but characteristic features of an object. For example, a flower has petals, a stem, and leaves. If those characteristics are present, then it’s a match. There is a bit of inconsistency because features vary from object to object. Our brain processes features in a parallel and distributed fashion. This means that the processing is happening at the same time in different areas of the brain."
"Top down processing is the idea that people use their previous knowledge to process information.  On the other hand, bottom up processing is the idea that people piece together new pieces of information in order to process information.  Both the word superiority and feature matching theories are examples of these types of processing methods that our brain utilizes. "
"Top down processing is when we take previous knowledge or expectations to guide our processing, and context is key. An example of this would be Word Superiority, where we can be reading something, and even if a word in the sentence is jumbled to where it does not make sense, our mind automatically decrypts it and puts meaning to the sentence we were reading. Another method of processing is bottom up, where we take details and put them into the bigger picture. An example of this would be feature matching theory, where we remember pieces of something such as the alphabet, and then generalize them to similar objects. So an L has a straight horizontal line, and a straight vertical line, so if I see something that has these characteristics, I will classify it as an L. "
"Top-down processing and bottom-up processing are methods by which the brain collects information. Top-down processing is influenced by the context of the information, while bottom-up processing is influenced by the sensory information collected. An example of top-down processing is word superiority. Word superiority is the idea that a letter is better seen and understood within the context of a word and that letters that surround a missing letter may suggest a word, making it simpler to perceive the letters in the middle. An example of bottom-up processing, the feature matching theory draws patterns from memory to be compared to patterns given at a specific moment of time."
"Top-down processing and bottom-up processing are routes of perception that are involved in making sense of input information. Bottom-up processing involves the collection of small pieces of sensory input information that are pieced together to create a full perception of those pieces as a whole. One way that psychologists conceptualize bottom-up processing is with the feature-matching theory. This theory is related to recognition, or the process of perceiving something based off of sensory information that is gathered and how that information relates to stored knowledge of what is being perceived. Feature-matching theory works off the idea that the brain has memories of specific features, and the right combination of features creates a certain representation. When bottom-up processing is occurring, the brain is being filled with sensory information, each piece representing independent features that are grouped together based off past memories. If those features (e.g., rectangular, soft, covered with squishy objects and a flat, thin sheet) combine to create a full mental representation (a bed), then feature-matching theory is at play and bottom-up processing has occurred successfully. In contrast to bottom-up processing is top-down processing. This type of processing is controlled by our expectations. Past memories guide how our brain perceives incoming sensory information and if some of that information is even noticed in the first place. When in a situation that has a certain context or connotation, the brain will automatically begin to expect various sensory information and a certain perception to occur because of prior knowledge, regardless of the eventual sensory input as a whole. Instead of relying on each individual piece of information from a situation, the brain has already begun to try to figure out what is going on or what objects are around it while that information is still coming in. This automatic type of processing that functions on expectations can be exemplified by the word superiority effect. Our minds expect and crave real, coherent words. Because of that, a “word” can be misspelled or represented initially in an incomplete or illogical way, but the brain will use top-down processing (with past memories and prior knowledge of the order and presence of those letters) to automatically and quickly perceive that “word” as a correctly spelled one. If the brain was using feature-matching to detect the word, it wouldn’t ever make sense because certain features would not be present. Likewise, if a person was in an unfamiliar situation and could only rely on top-down processing, their lack of prior knowledge wouldn’t allow for any kind of perception of that situation. They would be like children in a complex and confusing environment. The different types of processing are useful and logical in different situations, and the brain’s ability to know which type to use allows us to be fully functioning and adapting creatures."
"Top-down processing is driven by our goals at that time, they can change at a flexible and dynamic manner according to our goals. Your goals beliefs, knowledge, goals, and expectations are what can alter what is meaningful or desired information to you. On the other hand bottom-up processing is when you can override the top-up process by a sensory event.  Top down can also influence our perception of parts of objects. Word superiority is the effect of manipulating the perception of a target letter. When words are all scrambled up that's when word superiority comes into play and this is what explains it. Feature matching theory is used so that we don't have to put so much effort into really looking for the missing letter because we use categorize simple characteristics in our brain to be able to recognize. It is like over categorizing things because when I think of fur I think of a dog but there are multiple things that have fur."
"Top-down processing is forming perception starting from a larger object and then working down to the details.  Word superiority theory is a form of top-down processing that says people have a better recognition of letters when they are presented in words rather than when they are presented isolated or in non-words.  Bottom-up processing is forming our perception starting with the small individual features and then moving to the whole. Feature matching is a form of bottom-up processing where we decompose a visual item into a set of small features in order to perceive the whole."
"Top-down processing is when we analyze that which is around us by using information that we already know and have stored in our memory; we are able to figure out what things are by using pieces of the things that we already know. Both the word superiority theory and the feature matching theory are examples of top-down processing. Word superiority theory is when we recognize letters better when they are in the context of a word rather than be themselves, so we are using that preconceived notion of a word to identify the letter or letters which is an an example of top-down processing. Feature matching theory states that we tend to look for characteristics or features of an object to match them with one another which, again, is an example of top-down processing. Bottom-up processing is when we do not have any preconceived notions and we must rely on what is right in front of us to figure out what something is. "
"Understanding the differences between the very similar concepts of sensation and perception is important in understanding how we perceive information in psychology. First lets go over what both sensation and perception actually is. Sensation is a physical stimulus that we receive in many ways, such as from sights, odors, and touching and is sent straight to the brain from nerve cells. Perception is the process of the brain putting meaning to information through memories or even emotions. Learning the differences between sensation and perception may help further our understanding on how we perceive things and we study these difference because of it. We study the differences because of how different they actually are, and studying the differences could explain why each person may perceive information the way that they do. "
"We discussed the Ames Illusion which is a set of illusions in one. People are placed in a what looks like a rectangular room but it is actually a trapezoid. This is called the rectangular assumption because it plays with depth cues and linear perspective. When people stand at the farther side of the room people look smaller, then when they walk to the front part of the room they appear larger. This illusion breaks our top down processing because our perception is tricked into thinking we see a rectangular room when it is not. Top down processing is influenced by the context of an environment, the Ames illusion breaks how we believe the room is shaped."
"We discussed the rubber hand illusion in class. We also talked about neuroplasticity, which is the process that allows for the rubber hand illusion to work. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain basically adapting to make the rubber hand apart of its own body. The brain is temporarily rewired to believe that the rubber hand is real. The brain perceives that the rubber hand feels the brush stroke, but it is all due to this temporary rewiring. "
"We study sensation and perception for a few reasons. One reason is to distinguish the two. Sensation is purely what our sensory neurons tell us is there whereas perception is what our brain interprets from the sensory neurons. By studying sensation and perception, we figure out the details of how we perceive the world and where the flaws are in our perception and sensation so we can better understand the world around us and how we make sense of it. We can also see how perception can affect sensation with things like the rubber hand illusion. By studying sensation and perception, we can do things like create prosthetics that can send signals to our brain to simulate touch or we are able to create virtual realities in current headsets with our understanding of sensation and perception. I would also like to interject a personal reason that I am sure a number of others must share: sensation and perception are just plain cool to study."
"We study sensation and perception to better understand how they both work together, yet are completely separate. Sensation is the processing of sensory stimulus, and perception is the brain processing the new sensory information. The Rubber hand Illusion is a great example of this, because while you're sensing the fingers of your real hand being stroked (out of sight), you're seeing the rubber hand being stroked simultaneously, so your brain accepts the rubber hand as your real hand. This means that while your processing sensory information correctly, your brain is only able to see the rubber hand, so your perception of the sensory and visual stimuli makes you believe that the rubber hand is your real hand. "
"We study sensation because it is the input of a system into your brain. An example is when we see or hear something crash on the ground. We study perception because it is how our brain interprets things. So the example is after we hear some thing crash to the ground we interpret it as a glass breaking on the ground. Both the sensation and perception are very important to understand knowing that they are reliant upon each other and it is something that we do without event know we are utilizing those skills."
"We study sensations and perceptions differently because while they are similar, they are not always the same. The same sensations can lead to different perceptions based on a number of things. For example, say I see the visual cliff that was a famous study for the first time. I may perceive that as being a real cliff and get scared. If I had just been reading about the visual cliff study in my class and then saw the real visual cliff I would be relaxed knowing it is only a hoax with glass over it."
"We study the difference because it is important to know how the two are different from one another and how they do different things to us people. Sensation is the sense we gather info from or about the environment we are in such as sight, sound, and smell, and perception is the process that our brain selects and organizes, interprets sensation we gathered. They work together well but they do different things. "
"We study the difference because they both have different problems. Sensation for example, is light going into your brain. Perception is how you interpret it. The many-to-many problem is an idea that ""sensation has both too much and too little information to explain perception."
"We study the difference because we can get different perceptions from the same sensation. Sensation is the sensory input we get from our eyes, ears, nose, or skin. Perception is what we interpret from the sensory information in our brains. Sensation can provide a lot about perception but it can also not provide enough information for perception. An example of this would be two people looking at the same inkblot picture. One person may see a dog and the other may see a butterfly even though they are looking at the same picture. When people perceive different things from the same sensation it gives us a reason to study why that may be happening."
"We study the difference because we can get different perceptions from the same sensation. Sensation is the sensory input we receive from our eyes, ears, skin, or nose. Perception is what we interpret from the sensory information in our brains. Sensation can provide a lot about perception but there are instances where it can't provide enough information. An example of this would be two people looking at the same inkblot picture. One person may see a butterfly and the other may see a face within the same picture."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because both are necessary and provide different functions. You cant rely on perceptions without the raw data you get through sensations. Sensations explaining events may not provide enough information without the interpretation you receive from your perception."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because even though they are extremely related and dependent upon each other, they are still separate. Sensation is the input into our systems (brains), and perception is the interpretation of that information, or what we make of it. An important concept in this is the Many, too many problem. It tells us that a sensation can give us multiple perceptions. An example of this would be touch. If my mother stroked my cheek, I would see it as loving and a motherly response to something else. If my boyfriend stroked my cheek, it would be loving but potentially sexual as well (I obviously would not feel this with my mother). If a stranger was stroking my cheek, I could feel violated, creeped out, or even in danger because of it. All of these different perceptions from the same type of sensation. "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because in order to understand how we sense and perceive information in our world we must understand the difference.  Sensation can be described as a process of identifying information, or raw data, in the world and encoding it, while perception can be described as giving the information that we encode through sensation a meaning.  Perception allows us to organize and interpret the information we encode through sensation, giving us a more clear understanding of what is happening around us.  It is important to understand the difference because one sensation can lead to a multitude of different perceptions and vice versa. Sensation can not accurately describe perception because sensation may include too much or too little information. One example of this would include the Nekker Cube used in the powerpoint and notes.  This 3D object with solid 2D lines can create different perceptions or ways that the cube is viewed while utilizing one individual sensation. "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because it allows us to fill in the missing pieces about what is occurring. We can get different perceptions from the same sensation. Information enters the brain and then data is processed by sensory receptors which creates the sensation. The sensations are then turned into perception when sensations are processed in the brain. We study the difference because we need both perception and sensation in order for each of them to function. In other words, in order to have perception, we need sensation. In order to have sensation, we need perception."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because it is important to know how the brain is processing the inputs and what it is doing with them. It is also important to realize that sensation and perception are tied together. When you hear a knock, your perceive what to do next. Is someone knocking on the door? Is someone trying to get your attention? Is there an intruder trying to get in? There is typically one sensation, but multiple perceptions."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because its how we interpt the world around us. Both sensation and perception play big roles for each other. Everyone see the world in different ways. Mainly do too, not being wired the same. Therefore, we all see things different, the way our eyes work with different shades of colors. Hearing maybe to low for some. Or accents maybe harder for some to understand than others. But with sensation is our in take of lighting, hearing and it all raw that this point. Perception is the transfer of the light being too bright or the noise being to loud. If we lacked that, how would we know to turn down the music? What if we did not there was more damage done because we lack that sensory."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because one is the information coming in from an external locus and perception is our interpretation of that information. Sensation allows us to interact with the world and perception is the reality we create in our mind based on that interaction. For example, if I place my hand on a red hot stove burner, I sense that there is an object and that it has a red appearance and that it has some shape. When I touch it, my nociceptors begin to fire and I feel pain. My perception of this event is that my hand got burnt from touching the red hot stove burner and next time I see it, I am probably not going to touch it. My perception may also generalize to anything that has a general appearance of a stove with something that looks similar to a burner that is red(a cooktop, a grill, a glass top stove, etc.)."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because the brain can be tricked to perceive something that was not sensed. This was shown in the rubber hand experiment, when the subject was tricked into thinking that the sensation on the rubber hand was actually felt by them."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because the main difference is the way our brain process it our brain perception of things is when we perceive something that is hot then our brain sorts that out into sensation so that we know that something is hot."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because they are different yet are related. Sensation is what’s going into our brains, all the input. Perception is what we make of it and how we build mental models based on those sensation pieces we have input and. So perception is interpret it. We can have different perceptions from the same sensation because sensation deals with too little and too much information. Sensation is a cube and perception is how we view a 3D cube, sometimes it can look like its coming from the back and other times it can look as if its coming from the front, it’s all based on our perception and how our brain perceives and builds the block."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because they are not the same thing although they're interrelated concepts and processes. Each person is different in their cognition that the same sensation can give off different perceptions. This is important to recognize because the visual processes in understanding each are very different. Perception is generated after an experience of sensation. An example may be that because it's a warmer day out during the winter that spring is coming sooner. The warm sensation gives you the perception that the new season is upon. "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because they are the foundations for how we experience the world around us.  While they are both different and separate, they compliment each other. Sensation is the process by which electric impulses are sent to the brain after we pet an animal, for example. Perception is the process by which we make sense and interpret what those impulses could mean.  If we did not study sensation and perception, then we may not be able to distinguish between different feeling inside of our bodies and the world would be a very mundane place to live.  "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because they are two entirely different entities. Sensation is both too much and too little information to explain perception. Many sensations can lead us to have one single perception, while one sensation can give us many many perception. For example, if we something small on the ground chirping with feathers,wings, and a beak; with a red chest and brown back, we should all perceive these many sensations to be a Robin. However, like we see in the game on AFV ""What's that Sound?"" the participant is given one sound (one sensation) and is left to guess what it could possibly be; oftentimes the participant is wrong and more often than not, I have a completely different guess than what the sound is too. "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception because they both play two different roles on how we understand our world. For example sensation is basically used in our environment by touching, tasting, seeing, hearing, and smelling. Without these senses there wouldn't be perception. Perception is basically the way we understand the sensations and then it is sent to our brains to make sense of everything that is surrounded by us."
"We study the difference between sensation and perception for many different reasons. One reason is because they are inter-related processes that are developed throughout our lives and we need to understand their differences and how they work. They are two completely different processes that take place when we see something and when we feel something. Obviously, we get sensation through our sensory organs. The organs figure out what exactly we feeling and send signals to our brains. Once the signal has been sent, that is when the difference between sensation and perception is formed. Perception follows sensation. Then after the perception process is finished, we are now able to understand or make sense of the sensation. For example, while driving, when we see the stop light (sensation), is different from determining what color it is (perception). After we get the sensation and perception, we are then able to make a decision of what we need to do while driving; go, slow down, or stop. This is why we study the difference between sensation and perception, so that we can understand, determine and be able to make decisions depending on the situation we are in. It is important that we know the difference between the processes because we have to be able make to ""make sense"" of what is happening or going on around us. Once we see something, we know it and then we can perceive it. If we didn't know the difference between sensation and perception, how would be able to understand what is happening? Make a decision? "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception for the purpose of separating and understanding the two. They're connected, yet completely different. Sensation is the material we gather through senses(sight, sound, smell, taste, touch). Perception is how the material I processed once it has reached the brain and decided What we do with this material/information. The same sensation can be perceived completely different depending on how the brain processes it. "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception in order to better understand their relationship. Sensation is the feeling we get and perception is all the sensations put together to better understand the world around us. This is important in medicine because we need to understand the sensations that a person is feeling and the way that they perceive pain in order to better help them. "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception in order to understand how they work together.  Since sensation does not always equal one exact same perception, we have to understand they are different entities that have different rules for making sense of them.  For example, if you feel and see brown fur, but you cannot see the entire animal, there are many perceptions of what the input you are gathering could be.  It could be a dog, cat, bunny, bear, and many other animals.      "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception so that we are able to determine when we are actually sensing something as opposed to when we just perceive that we are sensing something. In the rubber hand illusion, the brain is tricked into sensing a tactile stimulus when the researcher brushes the rubber hand because it perceives that its own hand will be brushed. One of the subject's hands is actually experiencing sensation, or sensory stimulation in the form of tactile stimulation, while the other hand is not experiencing any tactile stimulation from the brush; however, the brain perceives that it is feeling the brush because it is using top down processing; in other words, the brain is using the context clues of the rubber hand looking like its own hand and its other hand being brushed to determine that the rubber hand being brushed is actually its own hand and that it can feel it. "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception to try to understand how our brains receive information (input) and then how it interprets (perception) and processes the information. For example, the rubber hammer experiment reflected participants watching their own hand and a rubber hand being stroked by a brush (input). When the rubber hand was hit with a hammer, the participant jumped or flinched thinking (interpreting) that the rubber hand was their own that was being hit with the hammer (perception).  "
"We study the difference between sensation and perception to understand how different each one is and how they affect our views on everyday objects and life. Sensation is the input we receive from any of the 5 senses, sight, touch, smell, taste, and hearing, and how we interpret and process these sensations becomes our perception. Now, for each sensation, there could be a plethora of potential perceptions an individual could have from this, and as scientists we want to know why."
"We study the difference of  sensation and perception because of the relationship they have to each other, one or many sensations can lead to a perception . Our perception is how we process and make sense of our sensations, each are related but not equal. For example, during the rubber hand experiment participants were tricked into thinking their sensation of their actual hand being brushed was possibly being felt by the rubber hand. The sensation of their real hand being brushed lead to the perception that the rubber hand was a part of their body which is why they jumped when the rubber hand was hit with a hammer. "
"We study the difference of sensation and perception because they are distinct yet often confused. It is important to study this subject because it is how your brain receives and processes information. You can get different perceptions from the same sensations, but not the other way around. Sensations are the data that comes into your mind; in other words, the input. Perception is how the brain interprets the information. Sensation involves the sensory organ of the eye. The cornea helps direct the incoming light. The iris is the muscle that controls the size of the pupil and the pupil changes it's size to let in different amounts of light. The lens of the eye focuses and bends light as it is entering the eye. The retina contains cones and rods that are sensory receptors. Rods are for night vision and peripheral vision. Cones are for color and sharpness.  The optic nerve is a nerve that is at the back of the eye and carries the info the eye has taken in to the visual cortex located at the back of the brain. These parts of the eye make up how sensory works and how it sends information to the brain in order for the brain to perceive what you are seeing. Other sensory organs are involved as well. Such as the nose when you smell, or your skin when you touch something. "
"We study the differences between sensation and perception because a sensation can produce completely different perceptions. I remember looking at an illusion when I was younger that depicted a picture of a vase that could also be perceived as two faces looking at each other. I remember seeing the two faces at first, while my sister only saw the vase. I also revisited this illusion during this course which was pretty interesting since I’ve experienced it before. Even though we are looking at the same picture which is processed by sensory receptors, our brains produced completely different perceptions."
"We take in information constantly from our environment and try to interpret what it means. Processing information can take form in two different ways: top down or bottom up. In top down processing, our perceptions are controlled by context information. We already know something about the situation or sensation and expect or assume something. For example, being in a crowded room and looking for your friend when you know what color shirt they are wearing. You will automatically focus your attention on anyone wearing that particular color of shirt and will most likely find your friend sooner than if you hadn't had previous knowledge about what they were wearing. Word superiority involves top down processing in which we are familiar with certain words more than others and will be more likely to recognize one word over another in a situation. Our personal preferences or experiences take over and interfere with how we process information. Bottom down processing is the opposite of top down in which our perceptions are controlled by sensory information only. We see the situation for what it is with no prior knowledge and process that information based on what we just experienced. Sometimes when we are given information quickly we take mental shortcuts, called heuristics, to quickly understand and recognize something. It is easy for us to identify things based on their prominent features. Feature matching theory is recognizing an object by its specific feature or features."
"We talked about depth processing and the visual cliff studies that were done with babies. In this study babies were sat down on a clear table, and then at the edge of the table is a clear surface. The experimenters wanted to see if the babies would crawl across the clear surface or if they would stop. In the study the babies that were younger, 3 months and under would cross onto the clear surface to their caregiver, but babies that were older 6 months and more would not pass onto the clear surface. The perceptual part that was broken is that perception is not something you are born with."
"When a person wants to communicate with someone, their is a specific pattern of electrical impulses that tells the mouth to move and the tongue how to form speech. In the frontal cortex, which is the most anterior portion of the brain, muscle movements are controlled, abstract thinking is controlled, and in the specific portion called Broca's area, speech production is controlled. When the signal to speak occurs in the Broca's area, an electrical impulse is produced, and received by a the dendrites of a neuron. The electrical signal travels down thru the soma to the axon and to the axon terminal. A neurotransmitter is then released, such as endorphins, epinephrine, hormones, serotonin, or dopamine. These continue the chemical signal through the synapse to another neuron until the wanted action (speaking) begins and ends. This makes up the ""mexican wave"" which is a live representation of the neuron sending a signal."
"When cognitive psychology first started it had come from philosophy. A man by the name of Wundt headed the first psychology labratory in 1879 and in that had an american student who used this to study all mental activity that he could. This was technically the beginning of cognitive psychology but it had a huge upcoming again in the 1950's when the first computer was invented and it helped scientists and psychologists study human behavior. There was big kick during this time to come up with better experimental methods. It was important since the computers were coming out to figure out the differences in information processing in computers and humans. "
"When it comes to perception, there are two main approaches on how it works. The first is the top-down approach, which is when we use information already stored in our brains. We do this by starting with the big picture and breaking it down. An example of top-down processing is known as word superiority. This means that we can recognize letters more easily if they are part of a word, rather than a single letter standing alone. On the contrary, the bottom-up approach is quite different. With the bottom-up approach, one is piecing sensory information together until they reach the big picture. So, the perception actually begins with the stimulus. Finally, a third sub-theory would be a theory that says the process of information is happening simultaneously. The feature matching theory says that we match things based on features our minds have set towards a particular object. "
"When looking at the cortical portion of the brain, it’s divided up in four different sections based on what the neurons in that area are responsible for. The neurons that area in the area have to be able to communicate with the neighboring neurons to pass the signal along. This process is demonstrated as the wave. A receptor on a dendrite will pick up a chemical signal from the synapse. If the signal is strong enough, it will start the wave of sending the electrical impulses down the axon. The myelin will speed up this transmission process, I this isn’t preset then it will be a slow wave. This neuron will meet another neuron to pass its signal off to at what is known as a synapse. This is a space between two neurons where they aren’t touching but it has chemicals to pass the message. These chemical signals are called neurotransmitters. They are sent from the axon of one dendrite, through the synapse, and picked up on a receptor on the dendrite of the next neuron. Each neurotransmitters has specific receptors that will pick it up. These neurotransmitters are responsible for telling the neuron the type of signal it is sending. At the front of the brain, kind of behind the forehead, is the frontal lobe. This area is known for motor functions, language processing, abstract thinking and attention. The Broca’s area is located in the frontal lobe. This is the area that processes what you should say in response to what people are saying to you."
"When our brains try to process or make sense of a certain environment , image or situation there are different ways of observing and processing this information. one way is bottom up processing this is down by processing the ""big picture"" of the concept at hand and then examining each smaller attribute and detail until you are at the specifics of the concept, image or, situation. Top down processing on the other hand is quite the opposite, this consists of starting with the smaller more specific details and processing information until you reach the ""big picture"" both kinds of processing can be seen in situations such as the word superiority and the feature matching theory. The word superiority phenomenon shows that people are able to recognize  worlds even when they are incomplete or misspelled due to the fact that our brains will automatically fill in words that we are familiar with. Another way this is expressed has been shown in previous studies in which participants were asked to identify a particular letter when either the letter is flashed on the screen or a word containing the letter is flashed on the screen. more participants were able to identify the letter when a full word was shown due to a persons tendencies to memorize the shape and spelling of a word better than just a letter. Feature match theory on the other hand shows bottom up processing in which it is easier to pick out a certain object out of a group of other objects with dissimilar features while it's harder to pick out in a group of similar features. In this case a person starts with the ""big picture"" of the processing and looks for the smaller details such as a similar of different trait. "
"When people pay attention, which is noticing visual cues in everyday life, they can pick up visual cues of a photograph or an object. However, change blindness can affect this. Change blindness is when someone overlooks obvious changes in a photograph or a scene because they aren't paying attention. Change blindness occurs because of endogenous attention, which is the voluntary control of attention. Endogenous is the opposite of controlled attention. Posner's cueing paradigm explains the difference between endogenous attention and controlled attention."
"When studying attention, there are instance where there is too much information to be processed all at once. Part of the information will not be noticed as much as other information. These bits of information that are focused on more are a part of the attention process. Sometimes, when attention is on a specific element, and the other elements aren't as notable, and a change in the less notable elements occurs, it may go unnoticed. This is called change blindness.  A part of an attention process where one's attention is on a particular element in hopes to focus to a more specific element that you expect to find within those criteria, it is called endogenous attention. Michael Posner attempted to breakdown the components of attention in a study by having the participants shift their attention to a different element. Some of the participant's had difficulties with this, helping to understand shifting in attention through cues in the area of focus and cues not in the area of focus."
"When things happen in our environment, we tend to attend to those things, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. Attention is what allows us to take in information from our environment for processing and focuses our information gathering in one area while simultaneously blocking out some or all of the rest. When we attend to information being presented, it can cause us to be blind to other things that may be happening in our environment around us. Change blindness is a direct result of that. Change blindness is a phenomenon that describes how we can miss information when there is a lapse in our visual sensory system. For example, as we drive down the road, if we get a text and we check it instead of looking at the road, we may not see the guy dressed as the statue of liberty dancing on the side of the road with a sign for Liberty Tax Service. The lapse in information from the roadway contained that man. This ability to shift our attention from one thing to another is called endogenous, or controlled, attention. Endogenous attention comes from within us and is voluntary. As we drove down the road, we made the decision to shift our attention from the road to the phone. In our day-to-day lives, we constantly shift our attention from one thing to another endogenously. I, for example, shift my attention from the screen to my keyboard, to the person next to me, to the lab monitor, back to my screen, to my phone, and back to my screen, all of which are controlled attention behaviors. Posner wanted to test our attention and how quickly we attend to things in our environment. In his Cueing Paradigm, he would cue the participants to look at a specific location, and then test their reaction speed on naming the target. He found that people would have a much quicker response time if the target was placed in the cued location. When the target was placed in a different location, endogenous attention took over and participants would have move their attention to the new location and identify the target. Shifting the attention to the new location took much more time and the identification of the target was much slower."
"When we are watching tv, we think we are paying attention. However, there may be changes that occur that we don't realize are taking place. This is called change blindness. When we are forcing ourselves to pay attention to something, this is called controlled attention. When we are paying attention to a general setting, such as when watching tv, this is called endogenous attention. "
"When we pay attention to something, which is actively finding something interesting and giving it notice we sometimes have change blindness to the surrounding area. So if we are focusing on a person playing basketball, we may not even notice if the opposing teams jersey color changed or if the wall color of the gym changed because our attention was focused somewhere else. Sometimes our attention is very focused, and this is considered controlled attention where we are in control of what we are evaluating. At other times, we may be looking for our friend at the basketball game, and know that they are wearing a green shirt, so we scan for anything green in the crowd. This is considered endogenous attention which is controlled and top down processing. We start with the background knowledge of the clothes and use it to focus our attention. Our attention is evaluated with things like the Posner's cuing paradigm, which tells us that controlled attention or when we know what we are looking for is a lot faster than if we are ""miscued"". Then it is much slower processing."
"When we stare at certain colors for too long, such as the orange and green flag we saw, we wear out our ""on off"", ""off on"" receptors that perceive certain colors. So wearing one out that sees the actual color, turns on the other that will then show us the opposite color, red and blue flag. Another illusion we can experience would be the Ames room illusion, that tests how we perceive rectangular rooms. It consists of us seeing a rectangular room, with two people in it. The person in the back of the room is very large, and the person in the front of the room is very small. What we don't realize is that the room is slanted, causing the person that would normally be smaller in our field of vision to become larger, and vice versa. This is a failing of a depth perception, particularly retinal disparity. "
"When we watched the gorilla video in class my attention was on the people passing the ball and I experienced change blindness because I never saw the gorilla. Now that I've seen the video I know what I'm looking for and I see the gorilla because of prior knowledge ( endogenous attention). Also, if someone would have told me to look at the center of the screen during the video giving me a cue I would have more than likely noticed the gorilla (Posners cue paradigm). "
"Wilhem Wundt was the first psychologist to study cognition. He did a lot of association tasks and Introspection. The idea of cognitive psychology started as a philosophy. This lead to experiments, which lead to more. Cognitive Psychology is now a science."
"William Wundt, of Leipzig, Germany, was the first psychologist that studied mental activity.  He kept his focus on understanding how consciousness works.  He opened a lab and his students focused a lot on introspection.  Other psychologists have continued to study mental activity but cognitive psychology came about when computers were developed.  Researchers focused in on the new computer as if it is a precursor to how the human mental activity occurs.  The computer was used as help to researchers to pin point the internal mechanisms that promote human actions.  "
"williams Artificial intelligence is where we give computers the capability to act as a human mind. This is done in numerous ways which several different types of computers or machines such as Siri. Siri is on iPhones and is used to carry conversation and convey information to the user. The computer “thinks” like a human and responds based on what you tell it. Experiments are when you want to test something to see if there is a cause and effect relationship. In an experiment, variables are manipulated and you have control groups so that you can ensure any changes are actually due to specific conditions and not outside factors. Cognitive psychology is the study of the mind and mental processes. Clearly, this relates to experiments because they can be performed in cognitive psychology to test hypotheses and gain information. Mind-brain connection is a debate about whether the mind and brain are two separate things. Overall, the brain has processes that it performs and the mind interprets those. The mind is the thinking aspect of it all. Personally, I feel that if you did not have a brain you would not be able to think (use your mind). So, the mind and the brain are related but they are not the same exact thing. Mind-brain connection is related to cognitive psychology because cognitive psychology studies the mind and the brain through experiments. "
"williams Attention blink model of attention is a lot like how it sounds. When we take in new information, there is a brief period where we do not take in some information. This is comparable to when we blink our eyes and miss the visual images that were present when we closed our eyes to blink. If you have a series of words presented very closely together, you will rememeber the first word but more than likely will miss the second word. Forgetting that second word is where you had an attention “blink” and missed that information. "
"williams Attention is what you are focusing on at the moment. It is a process that allows you to think about what you want to be thinking about and allows you to block out those things you don’t want to focus on at the moment. Change Blindness is where we miss a big visual change that should appear to be obvious. These relate because if our attention is not focused on our visual field but on something else, then we will experience change blindness where we do not notice those big changes. We have selective attention where we focus on one thing and ignore everything else. Endogenous attention is the type of attention where we choose what we want to focus on. For example, if I go home and am looking through the refrigerator for something to eat then I am using endogenous/controlled attention because I picked what I wanted to focus on. This is clearly related to attention and change blindness because it is a type of attention. In addition, if we are choosing to focus on one thing, we will miss changes in our visual field which then leads to change blindness. Posner’s cueing paradigm says that when we are shown a place to look, the time it takes to find the target depends on whether or not we are miscued. If the target is in the cued locatin (where out attention is already focused on), then we are obviously quick to name the target. If it is in a miscued location, then we are slower to name the target. So, this is related because it involves the attention process and what we are focuing on in the moment. In addition, change blindness may occus if we are focusing on something other than the cued location (we will miss the target). Last, we may or may not be choosing to focus on the cued location (endogenous attention). Overall, all of these are different aspects of attention that all relate to each other. "
"williams Cognitive psychology started with Wilhelm Wundt. He headed the first lab in Germany. In addition, this is when the idea of introspection came about. Introspection is kind of like “thinking about thinking”, it’s where you look inside the brain to evaluate your thoughts. Cognitive psychology also started out with the help of Edward Titchener (a student of Wundt’s). He decided to cover all areas of mental activity, not just feelings. These two were the first to study something that could not be seen (thinking and mental processes). I would say that cognivive psychology started being researched because of behaviorism. Behaviorism was about researching things that you could physically see, so this kind of pushed cognivive psychologists into doing some more research to fight back against behaviorism. "
"williams Embodied cognition is the idea that the parts of the brain that are active when you actually perform a task are the same when you are imagining the task (versus actually performing the task). So, if your brain is imagining you picking up a piece of paper off of the floor, the same part of the brain would be active as if you were actually picking up a piece of paper on the floor. Another example is if I was imagining dancing around to my favorite song, then the same region of my brain would be active as it would be if I were physically dancing around to my favorite song. Overall, the region of the brain that is involved in tasks is the same whether or not you are imagining the task or actually performing the task."
"williams In my opinion, the temporal lobe would be the worst one to break. I say this because this is where the hiccocampus is located which is in charge of certain aspects of memory. One of the functions of the hiccocampus involves spacial memory; therefore, if this were damaged, I would not be able to form new memories or know my way around. I would forget where I lived, forget where Wal-Mart is, etc. I think this would be the worst one to break because I would have to rely on other people for everything. I would never be able to go out on my own because I would not be able to remember where anything was. In addition, I would not be able to remember new memories. I think that would be very hard. You could not form any new friendships or relationships with others because you just would not be able to remember them. "
"williams One illusion we saw in the modules is the illusion with the dragon. In this illusion, whenever you moved it looked like the dragon’s face was watching you and following you. If you turned your head side to side he would move, as well as if you moved up or down. The perceptual process broken in this illusion deals with depth cues. Every time we see a face in real life it is three dimensional and we know that it is sticking out. Since we expect faces to come out at us (rather than go in or be backwards), we misinterpret the dragon to appear as if it is looking at us. We are using our experiences and past expectations to trick ourselves into believing that the dragon head is actually following us. If you go far enough to the side; however, you can see that the dragon head is not really following you and it is just an illusion. "
"williams The Mexican Wave is how the neurons communicate with each other in and outside of each neuron. It is an electro-chemical process. The first step in the Mexican Wave is the neurotransmitters  send a message. Neurotransmitters are the chemical way that neurons communicate with each other. They give signals across a synapse from one neuron to another. Then, dendrites receive the message from the neurotransmitters. Once the dendrites receive the message, the message travels down the axon. Depending on the myelin sheath, this could be fast or slow. If the axon is myelinated then the message doesn’t have to stop; therefore, the message is sent quicker. Although, if it not myelinated it has to stop which slows down the process. The frontal lobe of the brain is the part that controls abstract thinking. This is related to The Mexican Wave because the frontal lobe is what is in charge of telling the brain what to do and making decisions. So, without the frontal lobe the neurons wouldn’t know what messages to send. Last, Broca’s area is the part of the brain that controls speech and tells people what they should say. Broca’s area is what helps us express the message sent in The Mexican Wave. For example, if a message was sent to say “thank you”, then Broca’s area is what helps us verbally say “thank you”."
"williams We study the difference between sensation and perception because sensation influences perception. Sensation and perception are two different ideas. Sensation is the sensory information that we are taking in around us. Sensation is pretty factual, there are not very many ways to interpret it. Perception is how we view the sensory information. This could vary from person to person. We take in the sensations around us and form our own idea or perception of what that is. For example, let’s say that there are two people. Both individuals experience the same sensations. In this scenario, let’s say the sensory information they are taking in includes them walking down the street seeing several people dressed in all sorts of outrageous ways. If one individual is from a culture where that is normal (such as American where individuality is expressed and encouraged) then they are going to perceive that is normal. They are not going to find anything strange about that experience. If the other individual is from a culture where individuality is not encouraged and everyone dressses the same, they are going to perceive that as very odd and strange. Both individuals received the same sensory information; although, their perceptions were different based on their own experiences. That is a simplistic example; however, it shows how it is important to distinguish the difference between sensation and perception. "
"williams Word superiority effect is where we can read words where the letters are mixed around because of what we expect it to say. We like to form words. For example, if I had the letters “I lkie cehese” most people would be able to understand that it is really saying “I like cheese”. We have a natural tendency to fill in the blanks using our own expectations. This is part of top down processing. Top down processing is controlled by context information. In the cheese example, the context information used to help figure out the phrase are the letters in the first and last spot of each word. We are using the surrounding letters to unscramble the words and put them into a sentence that makes sense. Bottom up processing is driven by sensory information (versus context information). Feature matching theory is an example of bottom up processing. Feature matching theory is when we view visual images as different features. Then we compare those features with other features already stored in our brain. So, if I had a diamond I would say that it is made up of four diagonal lines; however, if I had a square I would know that it is made of four straight lines. Therefore, if I were to look at a picture of a square I would remember that it is not a diamond because diamonds have diagonal lines and squares have straight lines. "
"wilson 1. The Frontal Lobe is located on the front end of the brain and extends to the middle of the head (where you would wear a headband, as said in the lecture). The Frontal Lobe has several functions; abstract thinking, attention, and it is responsible for speech production. It also controls our judgement. Also in this part of the brain is the Broca's. The Broca's tells us how to respond to what we are hearing. So when someone is speaking to us and we go to respond, it is this area of the brain that helps us to come up with a response. Going along with this area of the brain are neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are all over the brain, and they help send messages around the brain to other neurons. They tell the next cells what they need to do. There are a variety of neurotransmitters: Serotonin, which deals with depression, Dopamine, which is what makes us happy, Epinephrine, which is our adrenaline, etc. When these neurotransmitters are release they bind to different receptors, and that is how the message is communicated to the next cell. Speaking of communication with neuron, there is the idea of The Mexican Wave. The Mexican Wave is an electro-chemical process, and involves the action potential between neurons in the brain. The action potential (The Mexican Wave) is how the cells communicate. As the message is traveling down the axon, the Mexican Wave is the process that helps get the message across."
"wilson 1. We study the difference between sensation and perception because we cannot have one without the other. Sensations are data that we receive through our sensory receptors, and perception is when the sensations are processed in the brain. Perception is the interpretations of the sensations that we receive. It is important to study because many sensations can explain 1 perception or there can be many perceptions about 1 sensation. For example when we looked at those different images where more than one thing can be seen, that was the idea of perceiving different things from one picture (sensation)."
"wilson 10. One way to test attention would be through dichotic listening and this involves the attenuation theory. The participant has two different things playing (one in each ear), and then you will see what they were able to recall from listening to the two different messages. Another way to test attention is interference model. You give the participant 2 words and the words begin to fight for attention and to test you see which of the words the person remembers. "
"wilson 2.  Attention blink is the idea that when people are shown a sequence very rapidly they will often fail to detect a second target that occurs very quickly (200-500 milliseconds) after the first target. The targets are in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). The participants will miss things that are presented closely together."
"wilson 2. Attention is defined as the process that enhances some information to be processed further. Depending on how much we enhance the information that information is set aside. In other words, we more we focus on something, the more we will process that information, and we can set it aside to remember later. Attention can be both a success or a failure. When it comes to the failures there are several areas of failure. There can be failure in the selection of space, selection of time, sources of limitation, and problems with interpretation. Looking specifically at the failures of selection in space, there is the topic of Change Blindness. This is when we pay attention and attend to things that we can see in our visual field, but do not pay attention (ignore) everything else that is happening. During Change Blindness we are paying attention to our central interest. An example of this would be when we fail to notice a physical change in our surroundings. An example of this would be the gorilla video. When watching the video we are so focused on counting the people throwing the ball, that we totally miss the gorilla walking through the scene. Our central interest is counting the number of passes, so we do not notice anything else that is happening. There are a couple different types of Change Blindness. There is the category of Top Down which involves the central interest. There is a second kind of Change Blindness and it is Bottom Up. This is when information breaks through our central interest like a loud noise. Bottom Up involves some sort of interruption. Like mentioned earlier there can also be successes in the selection of attention. Examples of this are endogenous and exogenous effects. Like its name suggests, endogenous effects are internal. This form of attention is partially voluntary, and is considered to be a top down response. This means that it is based on what we know. Like the example mentioned in the lecture, if we know our friend is wearing green we will search all the green in the room until we find our friend. There have been several tests and studies done to study how attention works, and what happens in the brain when it comes to attention. One study was Posner’s Cueing Paradigm. This study dealt with automatic attention. It involves a target and another shape, and it tested the reaction time in regards to the attention that was given to the target."
"wilson 3. Cognitive Psychology is the study of the thinking mind. The birth of cognitive psychology came about in a response to the idea of behaviorism. This happened in 1957. One of the first groups to use cognitive psychology was the military. They used the cognitive idea to test draftees to see what area they would be most successful in. Ever since 1957 cognitive psychology has been a growing topic of study. Cognition is used hand in hand with computers. The two are linked together because the computers helps the researchers understand the internal workings that produce certain behaviors. The computers are used as a model of the brain to help scientists understand what is happening in our heads. The first computer used was BINAC, which stands for a binary automatic computer. This computer led to the topic of artificial intelligence. This is when a computer is simulating the mind. An example of this would be SIRI. Newell and Simon, who worked with the idea of artificial intelligence, used computers to help understand different aspects of the brain. They would test an idea, see how the computer reacted, then see if people could do the same idea, and then collect data. Going along with learning about how our brains work is the idea of Mind-Brain. This is the question about whether the mind and brain are the same thing or are they separate? This involves the different levels of analysis. First they look at it at a physiological level-- this involves the neurons and the physical brain. Then there is the mental aspect, which involves thinking. In the study of mind-brain, the mind is emergent from the brain. They are related, but they are different. The mind is based on what is happening in the brain. One important aspect of cognitive psychology and the different areas of research is experiments. The experiments allow the manipulation of variables, so we can further understand how something works. Cognitive psychology is a science because it is tested through different experiments. Experiments are important because they lead to theories that help us learn more which leads to more studying."
"wilson 3. One type of brain research is Behavioral. This method involves behaviors that are observable. A big category for this method is reaction times. One type of this research is accuracy. This would be based on memory recall like asking a question from a chapter that is being taught, and seeing if the student answers accurately."
"wilson 4.  When it comes to the visual aspect of the brain there are many processes and theories that are involved. There are two different pathways in the visual system. There is the dorsal pathway which tells us where things are, and there is the ventral pathway that tells us what we are seeing. These two pathways work by different kinds of processing. The first type of processing is Bottom Up Processing, which is controlled by our sensory information. Bottom Up Processing had different detectors that are important for our 3-D vision and reading. These detectors are based on responses to negative and positive light that enters our eyes and goes to the rods and cones. Bottom UP Processing deals with depth perception and many different cues. Ideas like parallel lines join in the distance, things that are far away are fuzzier, and the lighter an object is the closer it is are all ideas that are formed during theBottom Up Processing. The other type of processing is Top Down. This type of processing is controlled by context information. This means that we are using background knowledge to form new perceptions. We use things that we already know to help us understand new things. Going along with the visual aspect of our brain there is the idea of recognition. This is the idea of matching sensory input to things that are already stored in our brain. There are many theories dealing with the idea of recognition. One of the theories is Feature-matching. This theory is the search for simple but characteristic features of an object, and their presence signals a match with something we have seen before. One good thing about feature matching is that is requires that less things are stored in the brain. We can just relate things to one another. So when we see something new we can just connect it to an idea that is already present in the brain, just like the idea mentioned above dealing with Top-down processing. We are connecting new information to old to help us understand and retain new things. Other theory dealing with the Top-Down Processing is the Word Superiority Effect. This idea is based on the face that our brain likes words. Our brain will make connections just to form words. The example given in the lecture helps explain this well. The idea of the first and last letter of a word remaining the same, and we will still be able to read the word."
"wilson 4. Cognitive psychology started in 1957 at MIT. It started being researched in order to respond to the idea of behaviorism."
"wilson 5. Embodied Cognition is the idea that the environment plays a role in the development of cognitive processes in the brain. One example of embodied cognition that I read about was in relation to perception. Researchers found that when people were looking at a photo they would often take the perspective of a person in the picture instead of their own."
"wilson 6. One of the experiments was whether or not we could tell the difference between an artificial intelligence response and a human response. You had to identify which response was given by a human and which response was given by artificial intelligence. The independent variable was the questions that were asked, and the dependent variable was the responses that were given."
"wilson 7. I think that the worst lobe to break would be the Parietal Lobe. I think that it would be the worst to break because it is in charge of the memory, and it would be awful to lose all my memories. If you injured other areas you would just lose sight, hearing, etc. But if the Parietal Lobe was damage you would lose all that you know and would be very lost in life. You would lose all your long term memories. You would also have a hard time balancing, knowing where things are in regards to spatial perception, or how do grab them. I think if you injured this area many areas of your life are effected."
"wilson 8. One of the illusions was the depth illusion. The process that is broken is depth perception. We are confused about how far away something is."
"wilson 9. One type would be geographical. You would use this type of cognitive map when giving directions. When you are giving someone directions you create an image in your mind of the roads and landmarks that they will encounter, so you can give them proper directions."
"Within the area of cognitive psychology, many different aspects of human cognition are studied such as the relationship between the mind and the brain.  One way that researchers study human cognition is by researching different types of artificial intelligences, such as computers.  Researchers have conducted many types of experiments in order to study artificial intelligence.  One way is the turing test, which uses a real person and a computer to have two different conversations with a person, and then the participant in the study must decide which one was the computer and which was the real person.  "
"Within the brain there are several lobes, the frontal lobe is one of the key lobes that handles functioning like the motor cortex, attention, personality, thinking, and emotions. Within the frontal lobe theres an area responsible for speech, called Broca's area. In all areas of the brain their are neurotransmitters that, use chemicals to communicate information. When their is a misfiring of the neurotransmitters, difficulties in speech can occur in the Broca's area, which is called Broca's aphasia. Neurotransmitters are made up of neurons that, can vibrate creating The Mexican Wave. Which is the idea that neurons vibrate causing chemical communication, that isn't supposed to happen. These occurrences can make a variety of cognitive disorders. "
"Word superiority is a top down effect which basically means that if you’re looking at a scrambled word, but the first and last letters stay put, you will more than likely know what the word is due to expectation. This happens because we perceive letters to eventually spell a word. Top down processing is creating an image of perception based on what you already know. Bottom up processing is essentially the same as top down except that it uses sensory input. Feature matching theory is when we match things based on features required for the object. These terms fit due to them all being related to how we perceive illusions and basic tasks.        "
"Word superiority is important to everyone, for example, hearing your name you turn and see what is going on even if you are not the one they are speaking with. Word superiority can help you identify some letters faster due to the target letter being more important. We see this with the Facebook games that say if you can read this you are smart, because the first and last letter in the word is the only one correct. This is where Top down and Bottom up processing comes into play. We can understand these games because top down processing which is context information helps us process the letters that are missing, while Bottom up processing is a sensory based help. This means that the outside environment help us to process what we are seeing. The letters that are missing is a good example of Feature Matching Theory which is when something or someone has characteristic features, and it is put into a category because of the characteristics. One example would be a horse. The horse has four legs, a mane, and people ride on it, therefore it is a horse."
"Word superiority is the phenomenon that people have better recognition of target objects with certain backgrounds. We used this with the target letter, similar, dissimilar background experiment. We processed the letter and found it more easily when it was with a background with similar features. Top down processing is when see something unusual and try to figure it out by looking for small details rather than trying to understand and look at the big picture. Bottom up processing is when we see something usual and it is easily seen because it stands out. These types of processing were both used in the experiment we did in class while trying to find the target letters in different backgrounds which brings me to the feature matching theory. This is exactly what we did in the experiment. We looked at a letter and by memory of what it looked like we tried to find it in the backgrounds provided to us. We tried to match the features of the letter we saw with the ones around it. Feature matching theory is when we make an attempt to match characteristics of an object to the characteristics stored in our memory. "
"Word superiority is the recognition of letters in a known order.  Top down processing is when the brain already knows the context of the information and is able to process in more depth to the sensory areas, or more concrete understanding.  Bottom up processing is when small information is built on and developed into a context.  Feature matching theory is the ability to identify an object by the features.  Word superiority can be used through top down processing.  If letters of a word are written in the order of ""an m l"", many people will be able to use the already known information to identify the word animal (through top down processing).  Bottom up processing would be more in relation to feature matching.  If I notice a lady off in the distance with long, red, curly hair, I may be able to identify the similarities to my mother, through would need to identify further features to know if it is her.  Through building on the information provided, I could eventually determine if the lady off in the distance is my mother or a stranger. "
"Word Superiority is the way that we perceive letters to always spell a word. Top down processing is creating a picture of perception based on background knowledge and expectations. Bottom up processing is creating picture of perception based on the sensory input. Feature matching theory says we match things based on a set of specific features required for the object. Word superiority, top down processing, bottom up processing, and feature matching theory are all related and fit together due to that they all work together to help describe how words and their object or meaning that is associated with them are formulated together to form the words and the contexts that creates the common recognition of those entities. "
"Word superiority is the way we interpret letters to consistently spell a word. Top down processing is our perceptions that are based from within our own knowledge. Bottom up processing is our perception based on sensory input. Feature matching theory states as humans we match items based on specific features essential to recognize a specific object. Feature matching theory uses bottom up processing because the mind is trying to piece together the parts of an object that we recognize to form an opinion based on the specific features of an object. For example, we see an object that has two wings and flies, we conclude that it must be a bird. Our minds use top down processing when we are typing because we already recognize and know the words we are wanting to type. Therefore, word superiority uses top down processing.  "
"Word superiority is the way we perceive letters to always spell a word, while top down processing refers to creating a picture of perception based on background knowledge expectations. The bottom up processing is based on creating a picture of perception based on the sensory input. Feature matching theory says we match things based on a set of specific feature required for the object. These terms relate together with how we perceive information and process it. Perception is the building blocks of how we input the sensory."
"Word superiority is the way we perceive letters to always spell a word. Top down processing is when you create a picture of perception based on background knowledge and expectations. Bottom up processing is when you create a picture of perception based on the sensory input. Feature matching theory is when we match things based on a set of specific features required for the object. It is a search for simple but characteristic features of an object. Word superiority is connected to top down and bottom up processing because you are creating a picture and perceiving objects. For example, you can perceive letters to spell a word by creating a picture based on background knowledge that you have from the alphabet and the words that you know. Similar with feature matching theory, you match a set of specific features for the object by using either previous background knowledge and expectations (top down processing) or sensory input (bottom up processing)."
"Word superiority is what I think of as seeing letters and knowing how to spell a certain word with those letters. This goes directly with top down processing because top down processing is how we process things based on previous experiences and our expectations. This is also similar to the feature matching theory, where we match things based on certain features that is has. For example, we may match a zebra and horse based on their physical feature of having four legs. This is all based on knowledge and experience (top down processing). Bottom up processing comes in as a way of perceiving something based on input from our senses. So instead of it being something we have previous knowledge on it is something we are currently having sensory input on. "
"Word superiority is when people have an easier time recognizing letters in words than do as just isolated letters. The top down processing is when the brain uses information that has already been in the brain, the bottom up processing is when people process individual items to make them whole. The feature matching theory is when decompose patterns into a set of critical features, which then is compared against past memory. These all have in common is what they are all are ways the brains processes and stores memories."
"Word superiority is when people recognize letters better in a word than just random letters. Top down processing is when we form perceptions starting with a large concept and work it down into smaller details. Bottom up processing is the opposite, like when we take small details and work them up into a big idea. Feature matching theory is a theory that states that we attempt to match features of something to features we already have in our memory. Word superiority relates more to top down processing and feature matching relates more to bottom up."
"Word superiority is when you look at isolated letters and develop them to become words and nonwords. The top down processing is when we use information that we already carried from our brain. It starts from our highest level of thoughts down to a low level function or senses, which is controlled by the context information. Bottom up processing is the information that is coming in from the sensory. Feature matching theory is when you are searching for a feature in a single object like wings, beak equal to bird.  To identify things we have to either use our word superior, top down processing, bottom up processing to figure out what we are perceiving. We use the bottom up to see things in context, impossible figures, and face perception in which we use top down for the word superiority."
"Word superiority refers to the event that people have a better rememberence of letters offered within the words. Bottom up processing is determined by the information from the external environment. Top down processing is guided by internal knowledge, beliefs, goals, and expectations. Feature matching models search for simple but characteristic features of an object. These terms fit together because they all focused on recognizing and processing objects from the environment, words, characteristics, and knowledge and expectations."
"word superiority- is when our perception of a letter is changed by its surrounding letterstop down processing - is when former knowledge/information is used to create a perception . Bottom up processing - is when our sensory systems are used for information in order to create a perception. Feature matching theory - When we use features of an object to identify what that object is. We don't have to see the entire object just a familiar feature to figure out what it is. Top down and bottom up processing is used in our everyday life to perceive the world around us. For example we use top down processing when word superiority occurs. Because prior knowledge tells us what the letter should be according to the letters around it. We also use top down in feature matching because we again take previous knowledge of features we recognize to figure out what the object is. "
"Word superiority, which is the theory that we are better  and more quickly able to understand words that are within a coherent sentence, rather than words that do not flow together, is a form of top down processing. Top down processing is when the brain attempts to understand something by first using its own ideas about it, and only after that utilizes sensory information to identify or understand it. In other words, the brain uses context clues first. Word superiority is a type of processing that uses this general understanding technique. In other words, we do not necessarily attempt to understand all the meanings of each word in a line of text, but rather use all the words together to form a general understanding of the entire line. we are able to read a line from a book much more quickly than we are able to read a line of words strung together that do not work together to form a thought or idea. Feature matching theory is a much more specific way of understanding that uses specific parts of a symbol, then searches the brain for a matching portion of symbol before identifying the symbol. In other words, we start the comprehension process by using certain cues and then build our understanding from there, which is what we do when using bottom up processing. Bottom up processing is when the brain begins at the specific (i.e., a sensory stimuli) to understand something and uses that specific clue to build an understanding of the whole. In other words, feature matching is a form of bottom up processing."
"Word superiority:  the idea that letters are easier to identify when they are a part of a word than when they are seen in isolation or in a string of letters that do not form a word.  Top down processing:  processing that involves a person's knowledge or expectations. bottom up processing:  processing that starts with information received by the receptors.  All of these term are a part of cognitive psychology.  They also make up feature matching theory.  Perception also has a huge role within these terms. Without perception none of these terms would be possible.  Sensations also play a role in these terms. "
"Word Superiority: The way we always assume letters grouped together create a word. Top Down Processing: Processing that is created by context information, expectations, or previous knowledge.Bottom Up Processing: Processing that is driven by sensory informationFeature Matching Theory: Certain features are required for an object to be recognized, if the features are present, then the object is a match.Word superiority is driven by top down processing because it is based on our expectations and past experiences of letters creating words. Feature matching theory, however, is both top down and bottom up driven. It is TD driven because we must use past experiences to build an expectation of what features must be matched in order to recognize the object (i.e. wings, feathers, two legs, beak, all mean bird of some sort). However, it is also BU driven because we must use these sensory experiences in order detect the features (i.e. smelling apple pie). "
